## June 27, 2025
**Earth Engine Server**
All noncommercial projects created before April 15, 2025 must verify noncommercial eligibility to maintain access to Earth Engine. Learn more if you need to take action in the Earth Engine [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/earth-engine/configuration).
## April 22, 2025
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
1.5.12
Added the [Google Drive main OAuth scope](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#drive), `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`, to the default list of scopes to use for authorization. The Google Drive scope is currently not required, but in the future it will have to be requested explicitly for Earth Engine requests that interact with Google Drive.
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
1.5.12

The Google Drive scope is currently not required, but in the future it will have to be requested explicitly for Earth Engine requests that interact with Google Drive.
## April 14, 2025
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Added `ui.Widget` styling support for border-related CSS properties, including `borderColor`, `borderRadius`, `borderStyle`, and `borderWidth`. This allows users to set border styling per side in the format `top right bottom left`, and to round the corners.
## April 09, 2025
**Earth Engine Server**
Announced [Earth Engine in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/new-geospatial-datasets-in-bigquery) and added [`ST_REGIONSTATS()`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions#st_regionstats), a new BigQuery geography function that invokes Earth Engine to efficiently read and analyze geospatial raster data within a geographic area of interest using SQL. In addition, Earth Engine datasets in [Analytics Hub](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/analytics-hub/exchanges;cameo=analyticshub;pageName=search;pageResource=?queryText=earth%20engine) now give you access to a growing collection of Earth Engine datasets directly within BigQuery, simplifying data discovery and access. See [BigQuery release notes](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/release-notes#April_09_2025) and [learn more here.](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/raster-data)
## April 01, 2025
**Earth Engine Server**
Added two new algorithms that allow reading data from BigQuery: [ `ee.FeatureCollection.loadBigQueryTable()`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-featurecollection-loadbigquerytable) and [`ee.FeatureCollection.runBigQuery()`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-featurecollection-runbigquery). For more details see the [Read from BigQuery](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/read_from_bigquery) documentation.
## March 17, 2025
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
1.5.7
Added `--version` to the Earth Engine CLI to return the client version.
## February 26, 2025
**Earth Engine Server**
Ingestion/upload of GeoTIFFs now supports internal masks [GMF_PER_DATASET](https://gdal.org/en/stable/development/rfc/rfc15_nodatabitmask.html). Only binary masks are currently supported. If an `ImageManifest` contains explicit mask bands, those bands take precedence over any internal masks. `ImageManifest` _cannot_ contain no-data values and GeoTIFFs with internal masks. GeoTIFFs that fail to meet these conditions will not be ingested and an error will be returned.
## January 28, 2025
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
1.5.0
The Earth Engine Python client library now requires a Cloud project when initializing with localhost or gcloud-legacy [authentication modes](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/auth#python_and_command_line).
## January 22, 2025
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
1.4.6
Fixed the processing of keyword arguments (kwargs) in the `ee.Geometry` constructors. Keyword arguments were passed to the `ee.Geometry` algorithm as though they were positional arguments. Check your use of `ee.Geometry` if you specified `evenOdd`, `geodesic`, or `proj` as keyword arguments.
## January 06, 2025
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Updated `Map.centerObject()` to use `ee.FeatureCollection.bounds()`.
## December 16, 2024
**Earth Engine Server**
Added new algorithm to find the bounding box of a collection: `ee.FeatureCollection.bounds()`. This should be a more performant alternative to the idiom `featureCollection.geometry().bounds()`.
## November 18, 2024
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
1.4.0
Released the `alpha upload external_image` CLI command to Preview. For more details, see the [CLI reference for external_image](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/command_line#upload-external_image).
## November 08, 2024
**Earth Engine Server**
All Cloud Storage reads through the `ee.Blob()` and `ee.Image.loadGeoTIFF()` algorithms must now meet the following criteria:
  * The bucket metadata must be accessible (check the `storage.buckets.get` permission)
  * The bucket must be located in one of:
    * The US multi-region
    * A dual-region including US-CENTRAL1
    * The US-CENTRAL1 region


Any bucket used in the month of October 2024 not meeting the criteria has been automatically allowed for future use.
## October 28, 2024
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
1.2.0
Dropped support for Python 3.8 now that it is end-of-life.
Added `ImageCollection.count()`, a static method that returns the number of images in the collection.
## September 03, 2024
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
0.1.419
Fixed a bug where the quota project wasn't being set when authenticating using the notebook auth mode. After this change, users must have the Service Usage Consumer role (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer`) on the authentication project in order to use the notebook authentication mode. See the Earth Engine [Authentication and Initialization](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/auth) guide for more details.
**Earth Engine Server**
Fixed signed int8 for ingest and export. For ingest, the system used to treat signed int8 as unsigned int8 with negative values mapped to [128..255]. Those values are now correctly assigned their negative value. For export, the system used to cast int8 to int16, while correctly storing the negative values. Export will now write an int8 with the correct values.
## July 24, 2024
**Earth Engine Server**
Fixed a bug that caused GeoTIFF exports with `cloudOptimized` set to true to fail if the output GeoTIFF was larger than 4gb. Earth Engine will now always produce [BigTIFF](https://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/bigtiff.html) regardless of the value of `cloudOptimized`.
## July 16, 2024
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Fixed a bug where specifying `minWidth` and `minHeight` style properties on `ui.Slider` widgets had no effect. Setting these properties now allows for horizontal sliders narrower than the default `minWidth` of 50px, and vertical sliders shorter than the default `minHeight` of 100px.
Reduced the maximum allowable header size of a GeoTIFF (produced by the `ee.Image.loadGeoTIFF()` algorithm or by `CreateAsset` as a COG-backed asset) from 32mb to 10mb. This change does not affect COG-backed assets with headers >10mb created prior to this date.
## July 10, 2024
**Earth Engine Server**
Fixed a bug that caused GeoTIFF exports to ignore `skipEmptyTiles` if `formatOptions.cloudOptimized` was true.
## June 07, 2024
**Earth Engine Server**
Changed the way that the `ee.Image.loadGeoTIFF()` algorithm and COG-backed assets select lower resolution overviews if a GeoTIFF is missing pyramid levels. Earth Engine will now resample to the nearest higher-resolution overview instead of the closest overview regardless of resolution. This does not affect GeoTIFFs that are not missing intermediate pyramid levels.
## May 10, 2024
**Earth Engine Server**
Added support for `overwrite` parameter in [`Export.table.toBigQuery()`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/export-table-tobigquery) method, which allows for control over overwriting data in already existing destination table.
## April 18, 2024
**Earth Engine Server**
Added support for the Bray-Curtis distance metric (`braycurtis`) to `ee.Classifier.smileKNN()`.
## April 03, 2024
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.397
Fixed a bug in `ee.data.listAssets()` and `ee.data.listImages()` that caused only a single page of results (up to 1000 entries) to be returned. This now matches the Python implementation, which returns all results by default. To return a single page in either client, specify a `pageSize` value. The documentation in both the JavaScript and Python clients has been updated to reflect this behavior.
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
0.1.397
Added [`ee.data.createFolder`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-data-createfolder) to the Python client to match the JavaScript client. Note that the `force` and `callback` parameters are not supported.
Updated the error handling logic for HTTP requests to convert `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` and `requests.exceptions.ChunkedEncodingError` to httplib2-like errors. In some cases, these errors were not being treated as retryable; now, the retry logic should behave properly for these errors.
## March 25, 2024
**Earth Engine Server**
Found and fixed a reprojection error which affected the correctness of some Earth Engine results from Mar 7, 2024 to Mar 13, 2024. See the [announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/google-earthengine-announce/c/wtSWwE8lLW8) for more details.
## March 13, 2024
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Added a new code annotation and warning message in the script editor to highlight usage of [deprecated Landsat Collection 1](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/landsat_c1_to_c2), which needs to be converted to Collection 2 as soon as possible.
## March 06, 2024
**Earth Engine Server**
Added `Geometry.fromS2CellId()` and `Geometry.fromS2CellToken()` for working with S2 (http://s2geometry.io/) polygons.
Added [`priority`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/processing_environments#task_priority) to Earth Engine `Export` batch tasks. This feature is currently only available when using a Cloud project that is registered for paid Earth Engine access.
## January 31, 2024
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.388
Migrated the authorization workflow in the JavaScript library from the [Google API Client Library for JavaScript](https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client) to [Google Identity Services](https://developers.google.com/identity/oauth2/web/guides/overview).
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
0.1.388

For more details, visit the [developer announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/google-earth-engine-developers/c/6J1SzhAQkHc).
## January 10, 2024
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
0.1.385
Added `__init__()` for docstrings and argument type annotations to `PixelType`.
Fixed authentication issues for the `gcloud auth application-default` calls to `login` and `set-quota-project`. Added the `cloud-platform` scope to the default scopes used by `ee.Authenticate()`.
## December 08, 2023
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.383
Added `Export.classifier.toAsset` and `ee.Classifier.load` for exporting and loading saved `ee.Classifier.smileCart` and `ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest` classifiers. The exported classifiers will be visible and managed just like existing Earth Engine assets. More details are available at our [supervised classification](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/classification#saving-classifiers) and our [export reference page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/export-classifier-toasset).
Added `getMapId()` to `ee.Image`, `ee.ImageCollection`, `ee.Feature`, and `ee.FeatureCollection` to match the Python client. Marked `getMap()` as deprecated.

More details are available at our [supervised classification](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/classification#saving-classifiers) and our [export reference page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/export-classifier-toasset).
Added `ee.Blob(url)` to allow type checking of the `url` argument and catch strings that don't start with `gs://` when possible on the client side.
Updated `ee.Authenticate()` and `ee.Initialize()` to support `colab` mode, added new `gcloud` mode for remote machines (which makes the `--quiet` flag no longer necessary), and introduced `localhost` mode. `ee.Initialize()` now uses ambient `google.auth.default()` credentials if present. `ee.Authenticate(force=True)` forces a refresh, but by default will now reuse existing credentials. See the [auth page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/auth) for the revised documentation.
Removed `opt_` keyword for parameters, with backwards compatibility with existing scripts that use `opt_` arguments. Note that some parameters needed to be renamed after removing `opt_` since they conflict with Python keywords:
  * `ee.Collection.limit()`: `opt_property` was converted to `prop`
  * `ee.Image.expression()`: `opt_map` was converted to `map_`
  * `ee.Filter()`: `opt_filter` which was converted to `filter_`


Switched from setup.py to pyproject.toml for building and installation.
  * Drops support for installing with `distutils`.


## November 29, 2023

0.1.369
Migrated Python client library from deprecated `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token` to `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` for OAuth 2.0 authentication.
## September 07, 2023
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.368
Added documentation to `ee.data.newTaskId()` and `ee.data.startProcessing()` to clarify unsubmitted versus submitted task IDs, and fixed `ee.batch.ExportTask.start()` to return the submitted task ID.
## August 24, 2023
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
0.1.366
Fixed construction of an `ee.Date` object from a `tzinfo`-aware `datetime` object. Naive `datetime` objects are still treated as UTC.
## August 17, 2023
**Earth Engine Server**
Added support for multidimensional arrays in `Export.table.toBigQuery()`. The BigQuery array format changed from `ARRAY<INT64|FLOAT64>` to `STRUCT<ARRAY<INT64>, ARRAY<INT64|FLOAT64>>`, where the first parameter is `dimensions` and the second parameter is `values`.
## August 09, 2023
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Launched Project-owned Apps feature to support app collaboration under a new project ID namespace. [See our app developer documentation for more information](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/apps).

Changed server behavior for dealing with dots (.) in [workload tags](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/monitoring_usage). Before, tags containing dots were removed from the request, now an error will be thrown.
## March 09, 2023
**Earth Engine Server**
Changed the default `BIGTIFF` parameter in the `GeoTIFF` image export options from `IF_SAFER` to `YES`, which always generates a `BigTiff` unless the `BIGTIFF` parameter is overridden in the [`formatOptions`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/export-image-todrive) dictionary parameter.
## March 06, 2023
**Earth Engine Server**
Upgraded `GDAL` to [ab9e803](https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/commit/ab9e80368ef662712c963191fd86fde2c5b75600) and `libgeotiff` to [a6fb3d3](https://github.com/OSGeo/libgeotiff/commit/a6fb3d3eb4c1af3aacfffd63308af280e12ec48d). Earth Engine uses [GDAL](https://gdal.org) to ingest assets and to export Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files.
## February 15, 2023
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
1.341
Added `ee.data.getPixels()`, `ee.data.computePixels()`, `ee.data.listFeatures()`, and `ee.data.computeFeatures()` to the Python client. The new methods will help with getting pixels from assets or `ee.Image` objects, and listing features from assets or `ee.FeatureCollection` objects.
## November 17, 2022
**Earth Engine Server**

For organizations with Google Workspace accounts, the organization administrator was given control to enable or disable Earth Engine by setting the Google Cloud on/off control. This control [can be set](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182442) for the entire organization or for specific workgroups. In August 2022, the organization administrators were notified of this change via a Mandatory Service Announcement (MSA), which included instructions for allowing access to Earth Engine. [Who is my administrator?](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6208960)
## September 28, 2022
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.326
Refactored `ee.data.getList()` and `ee.data.listImages()` to call through to `ee.data.listAssets()` exclusively.
Upgraded the client libraries to use the Earth Engine `v1` API parameters instead of `v1alpha` only parameters, in preparation for a future migration to the `v1` API.

**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
0.1.317
Added a `localhost` auth mode and introduced a `ee.oauth.Flow` class for smoother integration with other client libraries.
Added support for Python 3.10 by removing the dependency on `httplib2shim`.
## June 27, 2022
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Changed `Export` logic in the Code Editor to no longer use the map bounds as a default region for the output. The `Export` behavior now matches that of the Python API, and calls which specify the [projection parameters](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/exporting?configuration-parameters) will remain unchanged. To use the viewport bounds as an export region, use `Map.getBounds(true)` as the `region` to get the geometry explicitly.
**Earth Engine Server**
Added Earth Engine as a Google Cloud product offering for commercial customers. [See details here](https://cloud.google.com/earth-engine).
## June 22, 2022
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
0.1.316
Added the workload tag API (`ee.data.getWorkloadTag()` and `ee.data.setWorkloadTag()`) to label computation and exports with a workload tag, which is viewable from the Google Cloud Console.

Removed legacy compatibility for enabling computation profiling. If you are using the client library below version `v0.1.275` please upgrade to reenable profiling support.
## February 18, 2022
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Improved the user interface for [Earth Engine App creation and management flows](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/apps).
## January 06, 2022
**Earth Engine Server**
Added `ee.String.equals()`.
## December 13, 2021
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Added `imageUrl` option to `ui.Button` and `ui.Label`. If provided, the image will be shown instead of the label text, which will then be used as a tooltip. As with `ui.Chart`, only images in `data:` URLs and [icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) loaded from `gstatic.com` are allowed.
Reinstated the `allowHtml` option for `ui.Chart`, while continuing to disallow external image display. Images in `data:` URLs and [icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) loaded from `gstatic.com` are allowed.
## November 24, 2021
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Added an "Output URLs" list to the Task Manager, so that, when using `Export.map.toCloudStorage()`, you can easily copy-and-paste to [add a tiled overlay to your Google Earth project](https://support.google.com/earth/answer/9394930#zippy=%2Ctiledoverlay%2Cadd-tiled-overlays-to-your-project), or for use with the Google Maps Platform JavaScript API.
**Earth Engine Server**
Added `ee.Algorithm.TemporalSegmentation.StructuralChangeBreakpoints`, modelled after R's `wtrucchange.breakpoints`. This looks for breakpoints in a time series of images, based on a linear+harmonic model of pixel values.
Added `ee.Geometry.coveringGrid`, which returns a collection of 1x1 rectangles that cover a geometry in a specified projection. This is useful to generate e.g. all export tiles that cover a region of interest, and is far faster than building such a tiling with client-side `for`-loops.
## October 19, 2021
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Removed the `allowHtml` option from the set of allowed options in `ui.Chart`s. This was done as a security precaution.
## September 15, 2021
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Launched a standalone [Task Manager](https://code.earthengine.google.com/tasks) and a new interface in the Code Editor's "Tasks" tab. See [our documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground#tasks-tab) for details.

**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.278
Improved error reporting for the case where the arguments of a function passed to map() or iterate() are used in client-side operations that don't contribute to the function return value. Since the function is executed server-side, it may not have client-side effects. See the [debugging guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/debugging#mapped-functions) for more details.

0.1.262
Added a mechanism for overriding the default OAuth2 scopes requested in `ee.data.authenticateViaOauth()` and `ee.data.authenticateViaPrivateKey()`. This can be used for requesting the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/earthengine.readonly` scope, rather than the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/earthengine` scope requested by default.
## April 15, 2021
**Earth Engine Server**
Added `ee.List.unzip()`.
## April 01, 2021
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Added `ui.Checkbox.getLabel()` and `ui.Checkbox.setLabel()` to get and set labels of `ui.Checkbox`.
Added a `textDecoration` property to `ui.Widget.style()`.
## March 25, 2021
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.258
Patched `ee.data.setAssetProperties()` to prevent cases when setting system properties to null or zero causes unintentional property deletion.
**Earth Engine Server**
Required the `update_mask` or `updateMask` parameters to be non-empty in `ee.data.updateAsset()` calls.
## February 12, 2021

Fixed a bug that could cause non-uniform sampling of points from small (less than 300m) polygons.
Added a "RAW_REGRESSION" output mode to the `smileRandomForest` classifier.
Added `ee.Number.signum()`, `ee.Image.signum()`, and `ee.Array.signum()`.
## January 20, 2021
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.248
`.evaluate()` and other JavaScript functions that take callbacks will now report exceptions that occurred within callback functions to the console (or to the top level environment in Node.js). If your code has such an exception you can handle or suppress it with `catch` in the callback.
## January 19, 2021
**Earth Engine Server**
Added `ee.Classifier.smileGradientTreeBoost()` ([see more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting)) from the Smile library.
## December 03, 2020
**Earth Engine Server**
Fixed double-to-float precision loss in `ee.Image.arrayReduce()`.
Added a step option to `ee.List.slice()`.
## November 19, 2020
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Fixed `ui.root.onResize()` so that the callback is not fired after the script is reset or replaced.
Expanded `ui.DateSlider` to accept `ee.Date` object arguments. Improved `ui.DateSlider` sliding behavior, validation, and error reporting.
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.243
Removed `ee.data.getCloudApiEnabled` and `ee.data.setCloudApiEnabled` from the JavaScript client library.
**Earth Engine Server**
Improved the reporting and handling of internal errors.
  * Added a `(request: ...)` ID string to "internal error" messages returned by the Earth Engine API. These IDs uniquely identify errors for debugging by the Earth Engine team. When reporting internal errors, please include this value.
  * Added a "Report error" link to errors in the Code Editor, making it easier to send feedback.


## November 12, 2020
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
0.1.242
Removed functionality from the Python client library which is no longer needed after the legacy API turndown.
  * Removed `use_cloud_api` parameter from `ee.Initialize` and `data.initialize` on the Python client library.
  * Removed the deprecated `data.startProcessing` method on the Python client library. Use `exportImage`, `exportTable` etc. instead.
  * Removed the `use_cloud_api` flag on the CLI tool.


## November 05, 2020
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Limit the minimum and maximum zoom level on `Map` or `ui.Map` objects by setting the `minZoom` or `maxZoom` parameters on `setLocked()`.
**Earth Engine Server**
The `loadGeoTIFF` algorithm no longer rejects files with a [Header ghost area](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/cog.html#header-ghost-area), such as those written by recent versions of GDAL.
The `randomColumn` and `randomImage` algorithms now take an optional `distribution` argument, which may be `"uniform"` or `"normal"`.
## October 29, 2020
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Improved error reporting for syntax errors, by highlighting the error line in the editor and positioning the cursor at the location to fix. Syntax checks are performed before a script starts executing.
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.240
Fixes image export parsing of parameter `skipEmptyTiles`, which may have caused `skipEmptyTiles` to be ignored.
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
0.1.240
Adds the task ID to the string representation of the task, compatible with the `repr()` function.
## October 15, 2020
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Fixed `Map.centerObject` when called with a single point. This now zooms to a small region around the point, instead of doing nothing.
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.238
Added file format validation and normalization to the `ee.batch.Export` methods on the JS client. Synonyms for file formats (e.g. "JPG" and "JPEG") are supported.
## September 25, 2020
**Earth Engine Code Editor**
Added an indicator for the number of times a task was attempted. Earth Engine automatically attempts tasks a few times because some failures are sporadic. Likely causes for retries include exceeding memory limit and a temporary resource shortage.
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.236
Added an `ee.data.TaskStatus` field for the number of times a task was attempted. This matches the value now shown in the Code Editor.

  * Eliminated one of the frequent causes of "Object too large" errors.
  * Fixed bug that sometimes caused failures when using `ReduceResolution` close to projection singularities.


## August 21, 2020
**Earth Engine JavaScript Client Library**
0.1.231
Changed the object serialization format, so that `x.serialize()` returns an updated format (which is already used in server requests). `ee.Deserializer` supports both the new format and the old format. These changes apply to all JavaScript and Python APIs. If you have code which serializes and deserializes objects, we recommend that you either upgrade all parts of your system at once, or proceed in stages by updating the deserialization code first.
**Earth Engine Python Client Library**
0.1.231
Added a `--long_format` option (and `-l` shortcut) to the `earthengine task  list` CLI command, to show additional information about tasks. This change enables callers to see start/end times for individual tasks.
