Computes a set of features by applying an arbitrary computation to features in one or more tables. Results are returned as a list of images.
### HTTP request
`POST https://earthengine.googleapis.com/v1alpha/{project=projects/*}/imageCollection:computeImages`
The URL uses [gRPC Transcoding](https://google.aip.dev/127) syntax.
### Path parameters
Parameters  
---  
`project` |  `string` The project id or project number of the Google Cloud Platform project that should be treated as the service consumer for this request. Format is `projects/{project-id}`. Authorization requires the following [IAM](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/) permission on the specified resource `project`:
  * `earthengine.computations.create`

  
### Request body
The request body contains data with the following structure:
JSON representation  
---  
```
{
 "expression": {
  object (Expression[](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1alpha/Expression))
 },
 "pageSize": integer,
 "pageToken": string,
 "workloadTag": string
}
```
  
Fields  
---  
`expression` |  `object (`Expression[](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1alpha/Expression)`)` The expression to compute.  
`pageSize` |  `integer` The maximum number of results per page. The server may return fewer images than requested. If unspecified, the page size default is 1000 results per page.  
`pageToken` |  `string` A token identifying a page of results the server should return. Typically, this is the value of `ComputeImagesResponse.next_page_token[](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1alpha/projects.imageCollection/computeImages#body.ComputeImagesResponse.FIELDS.next_page_token)` returned from the previous call to the `imageCollection.computeImages` method.  
`workloadTag` |  `string` User supplied tag to track this computation.  
### Response body
Response message for EarthEngineService.ComputeImages.
If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:
JSON representation  
---  
```
{
 "images": [
  {
   object (EarthEngineAsset[](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1alpha/projects.assets#EarthEngineAsset))
  }
 ],
 "nextPageToken": string
}
```
  
Fields  
---  
`images[]` |  `object (`EarthEngineAsset[](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1alpha/projects.assets#EarthEngineAsset)`)` The list of images matching the query.  
`nextPageToken` |  `string` A token to retrieve the next page of results. Pass this value in the `ComputeImagesRequest.page_token[](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1alpha/projects.imageCollection/computeImages#body.request_body.FIELDS.page_token)` field in the subsequent call to the `imageCollection.computeImages` method to retrieve the next page of results.
