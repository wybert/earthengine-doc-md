Teach others to use Earth Engine! This page includes training materials developed by the Earth Engine team for hands-on coding workshops using the JavaScript API as well as [externally developed training materials](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/ttt#externally-developed-training-materials). Trainings typically start with a one hour lecture ([slides provided below](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/ttt#slides-for-a-one-hour-introductory-lecture)) and proceed to a "follow me" style coding lab in which the instuctor writes code in the [Earth Engine Code Editor](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/code.earthengine.google.com) (projected such that participants see it) and participants follow along in their own code editors. The code and instructional content are provided below for a [beginner workshop](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/ttt#instructor-reference-for-a-beginning-workshop) (no previous Earth Engine experience necessary) and an [intermediate workshop](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/ttt#instructor-reference-for-an-intermediate-workshop) (for users who have Earth Engine experience equivalent to that provided in the beginner workshop). The hands-on workshops generally take _at least_ two hours, depending on particpant experience.
### Prerequisites
No previous experience with Earth Engine or JavaScript is necessary for the beginner workshop, but programming experience, basic knowledge of remote sensing and/or GIS are highly desirable. Willingness to learn programming is required. Particpants with no programming experience will require additional attention. Depending on the overall skill level of the participants, the overall time to completion could vary between two to four hours.
### Before the Workshop
All particpants should bring a laptop computer with Google Chrome installed. Each participant should have registered to use Earth Engine _prior_ to the workshop. Direct attendees to the [signup page](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#/) _before_ the workshop. Instructors may want to organize pre-written scripts into repositories to share with particpants as described in the training docs.
### Slides for a one hour introductory lecture
These slides are for an approximately one hour lecture to introduce Earth Engine. Each is explained in the presenter notes.

## Externally developed training materials
### Spatial Thoughts
#### End-to-End Google Earth Engine
[This course](https://spatialthoughts.com/courses/google-earth-engine/) by [Ujaval Gandhi](https://spatialthoughts.com/about/), founder of Spatial Thoughts, covers the full range of topics in Earth Engine to give participants practical skills to master the platform and implement their remote sensing projects.
It includes 24 hours of live instruction (typically 6 sessions of 4 hours each) and includes a wide range of hands-on exercises.
### SERVIR-Mekong
The following training materials were developed in support of the [SERVIR-Mekong program](https://servir.adpc.net/) and include contributions from the [US Forest Service Geospatial Technology and Applications Center](https://www.fs.fed.us/gstc/), [WinRock](https://www.winrock.org/), and the [Spatial Informatics Group](https://sig-gis.com/). These exercises and case studies have been used to teach Earth Engine in the Mekong basin and other areas to build geospatial capacity at regional institutions. They are intended to familiarize participants with the Earth Engine platform and basic methods for visualization, data creation, cloud masking and compositing.
#### English
#### Spanish
The Spanish versions were created by the [Spatial Informatics Group](https://sig-gis.com/) with support from FAO's Analysis and Mapping of Impacts Under Climate Change for Adaptation and Food Security (AMICAF) program.
#### Vietnamese
The Vietnamese versions were created by [SERVIR-Mekong](https://servir.adpc.net/) in conjunction with the [Spatial Informatics Group](https://sig-gis.com/) and the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/).
