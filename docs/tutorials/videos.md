## Importing and Exporting
Topics covered include importing and exporting Earth Engine data, the command line interface, and map publishing.
## Classification
Learn all about classifiers (both supervised and unsupervised), training data, test data, the dreaded "computed value too large" message, and the awesome linear regression reducer.

Topics covered include supervised and unsupervised classification.
## Machine Learning
### Machine Learning Best Practices
With the pace of modern machine learning, building and training neural networks is hard. Learn some best practices and sift through the overwhelming amount of information available with a focus on remote sensing.

### Neural Segmentation
Arguably the most common application of ML to earth observation imagery is pixel level segmentation and regression. With neural networks, a whole new set of techniques are possible that eclipse existing methods in terms of generality, but come with their own set of challenges. Learn applications and training regimens ranging from supervised to fully unsupervised.
