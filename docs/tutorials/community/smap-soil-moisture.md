The thematic focus is learning about the SMAP instrument for water resources management applications.
The learning objectives of this tutorial:
  * Understand how SMAP measures soil moisture from space
  * Know which SMAP products are available in GEE catalog and the differences between the products
  * Know how to import SMAP products into the Code Editor
  * Visualize SMAP by adding visualization parameters
  * Plot a time series of SMAP soil moisture for a point geometry


After completing this tutorial, you will be able to choose the optimal SMAP product for your analysis/application, as well as import, visualize, and analyze a time series of SMAP soil moisture data in Google Earth Engine.
## Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
### Mission objective
The [SMAP mission](https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/) is an orbiting observatory that measures the amount of water in the surface soil everywhere on Earth. Soil moisture is an important measurement for weather forecasting, drought and flood predictions, agriculture, and more.
### Instrument description
  * SMAP was launched in January, 2015 and started operation in April, 2015 with two instruments onboard to measure soil moisture: an active radar and a passive radiometer. The radar instrument ceased operation in early 2015 due to failure of radar power supply, but collected close to 3 months of science data that are available from the [Alaska Satellite Facility](https://asf.alaska.edu/). The passive L-band radiometer collects daily data at 6 a.m. (descending) and 6 p.m. (ascending) local solar time for complete global coverage every 2–3 days. This permits changes, around the world, to be observed over time scales ranging from major storms to repeated measurements of changes over the seasons.
  * The radiometer specifications are described in the table below.
Frequency | Polarization | Resolution | Relative accuracy  
---|---|---|---  
1.41 Ghz | H, V | 36-km original, 9-km enhanced | 1.3 K  
  * SMAP's radiometer collects naturally emitted energy from the surface with a 20-foot-wide mesh antenna that rotates 14 times per minute – the largest such spinning antenna in space.

### What does SMAP measure?
  * SMAP measures how much water is in the top layer (5 cm) of soil everywhere on Earth not covered with water or not frozen. It also distinguishes between ground that is frozen or thawed.
  * Where the ground is not frozen, SMAP measures the amount of water found between the minerals, rocky material, and organic particles found in soil everywhere in the world.
  * SMAP measures liquid water in the top layer of ground but is not able to measure the ice.


### How does SMAP measure soil moisture?
  * All types of soil emit microwave radiation, but the amount of water changes how much of this energy is emitted.
  * The drier the soil, the more microwave energy; the wetter the soil, the less energy.
  * Radiometers measure this radiation, and scientists use the data to calculate water content.
  * SMAP measures radiation in the L-band microwave wavelength (30–15 cm & 1–2 Ghz frequency). This wavelength of energy penetrates clouds, so SMAP can measure soil moisture regardless of cloudy conditions.

## SMAP products in GEE
There are three different SMAP products available in the catalog.
  1. [SPL3SMP_E.005 Level 3 product](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_SMAP_SPL3SMP_E_005)
     * This Level-3 (L3) soil moisture product provides a daily composite of global land surface conditions retrieved by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-Band radiometer.
temporal resolution | gridded resolutions | availability | uses  
---|---|---|---  
Daily | 9 km | March 31, 2015 - present | L-band brightness temperature measures from this product can be used to analyze soil moisture, fine fuel moisture content, ocean salinity, and sea ice thickness. The L3 surface soil moisture product is highly accurate, within 4%.The attenuation of soil-emitted radiation by vegetation limits the accuracy of the soil moisture estimates in densely forested areas, therefore masking the data with the retrieval quality flag bands is recommended.  
     * Data outages: June 19-July 23, 2019; September 20-October 6th, 2022
  2. [SPL4SMGP.007 Level 4 product](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_SMAP_SPL4SMGP_007)
     * The SMAP Level-4 (L4) Soil Moisture product includes surface soil moisture (0-5 cm vertical average), root-zone soil moisture (0-100 cm vertical average), and additional research products (not validated), including surface meteorological forcing variables, soil temperature, evapotranspiration, and net radiation.
temporal resolution | gridded resolutions | availability | uses  
---|---|---|---  
3-hourly | 11 km | March 31, 2015 - present | Modeled outputs of surface and root zone soil moisture with full global coverage and high temporal frequency.  
     * SMAP L4 provides uninterrupted soil moisture data. During outages of the SMAP instrument, SMAP L4 soil moisture is based on land model simulations alone, without the concomitant assimilation of SMAP brightness temperature observations. Significant SMAP instrument outages occurred between 19 June and 23 July 2019 and between 6 August and 20 September 2022.
  3. [NASA-USDA Enhanced SMAP](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_USDA_HSL_SMAP10KM_soil_moisture)
     * The NASA-USDA Enhanced SMAP global soil moisture data provides soil moisture information across the globe at 10-km spatial resolution. This dataset includes surface and subsurface soil moisture (mm), soil moisture profile (%), as well as surface and subsurface soil moisture anomalies (-).
     * The dataset is generated by integrating satellite-derived Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 2 soil moisture observations into the modified two-layer Palmer model using a 1-D Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation approach. Soil moisture anomalies were computed from the climatology of the day of interest. The climatology was estimated based on the full data record of the SMAP satellite observation and the 31-day-centered moving-window approach. The assimilation of the SMAP soil moisture observations help improve the model-based soil moisture predictions particularly over poorly instrumented areas of the world that lack good quality precipitation data.
     * This dataset was developed by the Hydrological Science Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in cooperation with USDA Foreign Agricultural Services and USDA Hydrology and Remote Sensing Lab.
temporal resolution | gridded resolutions | availability | uses  
---|---|---|---  
Daily | 10 km | April 2, 2015 - August 2, 2022 | Modeled surface and root zone soil moisture from the USDA-FAS Palmer model for agricultural drought monitoring.  
     * As of August 2022, the NASA-USDA Enhanced SMAP Global soil moisture product has been discontinued.


The table below describes the surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and soil moisture anomaly bands available with each product.
