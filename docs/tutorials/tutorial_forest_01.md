Welcome to the Google Earth Engine tutorial for using [Hansen et al. (2013)](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850) global forest cover and change data and Forest Monitoring for Action (FORMA, [Hammer et al. 2009](https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/1423248_file_Hammer_Kraft_Wheeler_FORMA_FINAL.pdf)) data from [Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/). This tutorial provides examples of how to use Earth Engine to visualize these data, how to compute forest change over time and other statistics within a region of interest and how to download both the data and results of analyses.

## Prerequisites
The tutorial assumes no programming background, although it does assume a willingness to learn some programming. Before proceeding, please make sure to:
  * [Signup for Earth Engine](https://signup.earthengine.google.com). Once you have been accepted, you will receive an email with additional information.
  * Get familiar with the [Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com), the IDE for writing Earth Engine JavaScript code in a web browser. Learn more about the Code Editor [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground).
  * If you are unfamiliar with JavaScript, check out the [JavaScript for Earth Engine tutorial](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_js_01).
  * If you are unfamiliar with the Earth Engine API, check out the [Introduction to the Earth Engine API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_api_01) tutorial.


Once you're familiar with JavaScript, the Earth Engine API and Code Editor, [get started on the tutorial](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_forest_02)!
