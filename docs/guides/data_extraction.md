##  Getting image data from Earth Engine 
To get image data from Earth Engine to Google Drive, Cloud Storage, or an Earth Engine asset, you can use [`Export`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/exporting) and the job is handled entirely by Earth Engine. If your export jobs have scaling issues (e.g. take longer than a day, return memory or timeout errors) or you're already familiar with a framework like [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/), [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) or [Dask](https://www.dask.org/), you may prefer the data extraction methods described here. Workflows implemented in these frameworks can be scaled using Google Cloud tools such as [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) or [Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc). 
Specifically, this guide describes methods for manually making requests for image data using [`getPixels`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-data-getpixels) or [`computePixels`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-data-computepixels). Here, "image data" means multi-dimensional arrays of pixel values with consistent scale and projection. The region, scale, projection and/or dimensions are specified in the request. The [ImageFileFormat page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1/ImageFileFormat) lists possible output formats. Output destinations include Cloud Storage or any locally mounted directory. Manual requests add complexity, but can scale to larger workloads. 
## Getting image data from existing assets
Use [`getPixels`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-data-getpixels) to get image data from existing Earth Engine assets. You pass the asset ID directly to the request, so you can't do any computation on the pixels prior to extracting them. A block of pixels in the specified region, scale, projection and format is returned. The following example demonstrates getting time series of NDVI from a MODIS image collection using `getPixels`.

## Getting image data from computed images
Use [`computePixels`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-data-computepixels) to get image data from a computed image, for example a composite. With [`computePixels`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-data-computepixels), you pass a computed `ee.Image` object through the `expression` parameter. A block of computed pixels in the specified region, scale, projection and format is returned. The following example shows getting patches of multispectral data from a cloud-free Sentinel-2 composite.

## Manual parallelization of requests
Though you can make requests for any purpose in any volume, you may want to parallelize requests for larger workflows. To make many such requests in parallel, you should use the [Earth Engine high volume endpoint](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/cloud/highvolume). The number of parallel requests you can have is set by your [concurrent interactive request quota](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/usage#concurrent_interactive_requests). See the [Earth Engine high volume page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/cloud/highvolume) for details on when to use the high volume endpoint. 
### Multi-threading
You can use threads to make concurrrent requests. This approach is demonstrated in the `getPixels` and `computePixels` example notebooks. 
### Apache Beam
You can use [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) pipelines to parallelize requests. These pipelines can be run locally or as Google Dataflow jobs. For examples, see [this Geo for Good training](https://earthoutreachonair.withgoogle.com/events/geoforgood22?talk=day1-trackthree-talk2) or [this People, Planet and AI demonstration](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/tree/main/people-and-planet-ai/land-cover-classification). Alternatively, other parallelization libraries include [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) and [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).
