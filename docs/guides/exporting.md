You can export images, map tiles, tables and video from Earth Engine. The exports can be sent to your Google Drive account, to [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) or to a new Earth Engine asset.
To use Google Cloud Storage (a fee-based service), you'll need to set up a project, enable billing for the project, and create a storage bucket. See the [Cloud Storage Quickstart page](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/quickstart-console) for instructions. See [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming-buckets) for information on storage bucket naming. Data exported to a Cloud Storage bucket will have the bucket's [default object Access Control List (ACL)](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/create-manage-lists#defaultobjects). You must have write permission for the specified bucket.
Choose an option from the side menu to learn more about batch exporting [images](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/exporting_images) and [tables](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/exporting_tables), [extracting image data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/data_extraction) programmatically, and more.
