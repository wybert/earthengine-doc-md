bookmark_borderbookmark Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 
Joins are used to combine elements from different collections (e.g. `ImageCollection` or `FeatureCollection`) based on a condition specified by an `ee.Filter`. The filter is constructed with arguments for the properties in each collection that are related to each other. Specifically, `leftField` specifies the property in the primary collection that is related to the `rightField` in the secondary collection. The type of filter (e.g. `equals`, `greaterThanOrEquals`, `lessThan`, etc.) indicates the relationship between the fields. The type of join indicates one-to-many or one-to-one relationships between the elements in the collections and how many matches to retain. The output of a join is produced by `join.apply()` and will vary according to the type of join.
