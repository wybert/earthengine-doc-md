USDA Texture Class at soil depths of 0-20 cm and 20-50 cm. In areas of dense jungle (generally over central Africa), model accuracy is low and therefore artifacts such as banding (striping) might be seen.
Soil property predictions were made by [Innovative Solutions for Decision Agriculture Ltd. (iSDA)](https://isda-africa.com/) at 30 m pixel size using machine learning coupled with remote sensing data and a training set of over 100,000 analyzed soil samples.
