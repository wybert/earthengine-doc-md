The United States Census Bureau regularly releases a geodatabase named TIGER. This dataset contains the 2010 census [block groups](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html#par_textimage_4), which is a cluster of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their four-digit census block number. There are just over 300,000 polygon features covering the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas.
For full technical details on all TIGER 2010 products, see the [TIGER technical documentation](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2010/TGRSHP10SF1.pdf).
