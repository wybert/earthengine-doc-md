This product is part of the Tree Canopy Cover (TCC) data suite. It includes modeled TCC, standard error (SE), and National Land Cover Database's (NLCD) TCC data for each year. TCC data produced by the the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS) are included in the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium that is part of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) project managed by the United States (US) Geological Survey (USGS).
The Science TCC product and NLCD TCC are remote sensing-based map output produced by the USFS. The objecive of TCC Science and NLCD TCC are to develop a consistent approach using the latest technology and advancements in TCC mapping to produce a "best available" map of TCC across the Conterminous United States (CONUS) and southeast Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico-US Virgin Islands (OCONUS).
Model outputs include Science TCC, Science SE and NLCD TCC. Science TCC and SE include data from 2008 through 2021. NLCD TCC include data from 2011 through 2021, with data fully masked in 2008, 2009 and 2010. 
*Science TCC is the raw direct model outputs.
*Science SE is the model standard deviation of the predicted values from all regression trees. 
*The NLCD TCC product undergoes further post processing applied to the annual Science TCC images, which includes several masking (water and non-tree agriculture), filtering, and minimum-mapping unit (MMU) routines, as well as processes that reduce interannual noise and return longer duration trends. 
Each image includes a data mask band that has three values representing areas of no data (0), mapped tree canopy cover(1), and non-processing area (2). The non-processing areas are pixels in the study area with no cloud or cloud shadow-free data. No data and non-processing area pixels are masked in TCC and SE images.
Due to CONUS size and wide variety of ecotones, CONUS modeling was broken up into 54 480x480 km tiles. For each tile, a unique random forest model was built using 2011 fitted LandTrendr, 2011 CDL, and terrain data. All reference data that were part of the 70% available for model calibration that intersected tiles within a 5x5 window around the center tile were used to train the random forest model. That model was then applied to the center tile. For OCONUS, one model was applied to each study area, and no tiles were used. 
Predictor layers for the TCC model include outputs from the LandTrendr and terrain information. These components are all accessed and processed using Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017).
To produce annual composites for LandTrendr, USGS Collection 2 Landsat Tier 1 and Sentinel 2A, 2B Level-1C top of atmosphere reflectance data were used. The cFmask cloud masking algorithm (Foga et al., 2017), which is an implementation of Fmask 2.0 (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012) (Landsat-only), cloudScore (Chastain et al., 2019) (Landsat-only), and s2cloudless (Sentinel-Hub, 2021) (Sentinel 2-only) are used to mask clouds, while TDOM (Chastain et al., 2019) is used to mask cloud shadows (Landsat and Sentinel 2). For LandTrendr, the annual medoid is then computed to summarize cloud and cloud shadow-free values from each year into a single composite.
The composite time series is temporally segmented using LandTrendr (Kennedy et al., 2010; Kennedy et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018).
The raw composite values, LandTrendr fitted values, pair-wise differences, segment duration, change magnitude, and slope, along with elevation, slope, sine of aspect, and cosine of aspect from the 10 m USGS 3D. Elevation Program (3DEP) data (U.S. Geological Survey, 2019), are used as independent predictor variables in a Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) model.
Reference data are collected from USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) photo-interpreted TCC data, and used to make wall-to wall TCC predictions on a pixel-wise basis.
