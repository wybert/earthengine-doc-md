The CPC Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Global Daily Precipitation dataset offers daily precipitation estimates over land from 1979 to the present. Developed by NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC), it leverages an optimal interpolation technique to combine data from a global network of rain gauges, with over 30,000 gauges contributing to the retrospective version (1979-2005) and around 17,000 to the real-time version (2006-present). Data is provided at a 0.5-degree resolution and includes both precipitation amounts (in 0.1 mm) and the number of gauges used for each grid cell, allowing users to assess data quality.
The dataset's quality is acknowledged to be poor over tropical Africa and Antarctica, and generally varies with gauge density. Real-time data is subject to revision as more complete station data becomes available.
[This](https://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/precip/CPC_UNI_PRCP/GAUGE_GLB/DOCU/) folder has all the technical documentation.
NOTE: The historical data spanning from 1979 to 2005 is not available in the current version of the dataset.
