This product is part of the Landscape Change Monitoring System (LCMS) data suite. It shows LCMS-modeled change, land cover, and/or land use classes for each year that covers the Conterminous United States (CONUS) and areas outside the CONUS (OCONUS) that include Southeastern Alaska (SEAK), Puerto Rico-US Virgin Islands (PRUSVI), and Hawaii (HI). 
LCMS is a remote sensing-based system for mapping and monitoring landscape change across the United States. Its objective is to develop a consistent approach using the latest technology and advancements in change detection to produce a "best available" map of landscape change.
Outputs include three annual products: change, land cover, and land use. Change relates specifically to vegetation cover and includes slow loss, fast loss (which also includes hydrologic changes such as inundation or desiccation), and gain. These values are predicted for each year of the Landsat time series and serve as the foundational products for LCMS. Land cover and land use maps depict life-form level land cover and broad-level land use for each year.
Because no algorithm performs best in all situations, LCMS uses an ensemble of models as predictors, which improves map accuracy across a range of ecosystems and change processes (Healey et al., 2018). The resulting suite of LCMS change, land cover, and land use maps offer a holistic depiction of landscape change across the United States since 1985.
Predictor layers for the LCMS model include outputs from the LandTrendr and CCDC change detection algorithms, and terrain information. These components are all accessed and processed using Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017).
For CCDC, United States Geological Survey (USGS) Collection 2 Landsat Tier 1 surface reflectance data were used for the CONUS, and Landsat Tier 1 top of atmosphere reflectance data for SEAK, PRUSVI and HI. To produce annual composites for LandTrendr, USGS Collection 2 Landsat Tier 1 and Sentinel 2A, 2B Level-1C top of atmosphere reflectance data were used. The cFmask cloud masking algorithm (Foga et al., 2017), which is an implementation of Fmask 2.0 (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012) (Landsat-only), cloudScore (Chastain et al., 2019) (Landsat-only), s2cloudless (Sentinel-Hub, 2021) and Cloud Score plus (Pasquarella et al., 2023) (Sentinel 2-only) are used to mask clouds, while TDOM (Chastain et al., 2019) is used to mask cloud shadows (Landsat and Sentinel 2). For LandTrendr, the annual medoid is then computed to summarize cloud and cloud shadow-free values from each year into a single composite.
The composite time series is temporally segmented using LandTrendr (Kennedy et al., 2010; Kennedy et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018).
All cloud and cloud shadow free values are also temporally segmented using the CCDC algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014).
Predictor data include raw composite values, LandTrendr fitted values, pair-wise differences, segment duration, change magnitude, and slope, and CCDC sine and cosine coefficients (first 3 harmonics), fitted values, and pairwise differences, along with elevation, slope, sine of aspect, cosine of aspect, and topographic position indices (Weiss, 2001) from the 10 m USGS 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) data (U.S. Geological Survey, 2019).
Reference data are collected using TimeSync, a web-based tool that helps analysts visualize and interpret the Landsat data record from 1984-present (Cohen et al., 2010).
Random Forests models (Breiman, 2001) were trained using reference data from TimeSync and predictor data from LandTrendr, CCDC, and terrain indices to predict annual change, land cover, and land use classes. Following modeling, we instituted a series of probability thresholds and rulesets using ancillary datasets to improve qualitative map outputs and reduce commission and omission. More information can be found in the LCMS Methods Brief included in the Description.

Name | Description  
---|---  
`Change` | Final thematic LCMS change product. A total of three change classes (slow loss, fast loss, and gain) are mapped for each year. Each class is predicted using a separate Random Forest model, which outputs a probability (proportion of the trees within the Random Forest model) that the pixel belongs to that class. Because of this, individual pixels have three different model outputs for each year. Final classes are assigned to the change class with the highest probability that is also above a specified threshold. Any pixel that does not have any value above each class's respective threshold is assigned to the Stable class. Prior to assigning the change class, a rule was applied to all study areas to prevent change in non-vegetated land cover.   
`Land_Cover` | Final thematic LCMS land cover product. A total of 14 land cover classes are mapped on an annual basis using TimeSync reference data and spectral information derived from Landsat imagery. Each class is predicted using a separate Random Forest model, which outputs a probability (proportion of the trees within the Random Forest model) that the pixel belongs to that class. Because of this, individual pixels have 14 different model outputs for each year, and final classes are assigned to the land cover with the highest probability. For Southeastern Alaska, prior to assigning the land cover class with the highest probability, a land cover rule was implemented to limit tree and snow landcover class commission in the large intertidal zones at sea level. No land cover rules were applied to CONUS, Puerto Rico-US Virgin Islands or Hawaii. Seven of the 14 land cover classes indicate a single land cover, where that land cover type covers most of the pixel's area and no other class covers more than 10% of the pixel. There are also seven mixed classes. These represent pixels in which an additional land cover class covers at least 10% of the pixel.  
`Land_Use` | Final thematic LCMS land use product. A total of 6 land use classes are mapped on an annual basis using TimeSync reference data and spectral information derived from Landsat imagery. Each class is predicted using a separate Random Forest model, which outputs a probability (proportion of the trees within the Random Forest model) that the pixel belongs to that class. Because of this, individual pixels have 6 different model outputs for each year, and final classes are assigned to the land use with the highest probability. Prior to assigning the land use class with the highest probability, a series of probability thresholds and rulesets using ancillary datasets land use rules were applied. More information on the probability thresholds and rulesets can be found in the LCMS Methods Brief included in the Description. The CONUS land use product was updated on July 2nd 2024, to correct an issue with the developed class.   
`Change_Raw_Probability_Slow-Loss` | Raw LCMS modeled probability of Slow Loss. Defined as: Slow Loss includes the following classes from the TimeSync change process interpretation-
  * Structural Decline - Land where trees or other woody vegetation is physically altered by unfavorable growing conditions brought on by non-anthropogenic or non-mechanical factors. This type of loss should generally create a trend in the spectral signal(s) (e.g. NDVI decreasing, Wetness decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.) however the trend can be subtle. Structural decline occurs in woody vegetation environments, most likely from insects, disease, drought, acid rain, etc. Structural decline can include defoliation events that do not result in mortality such as in Gypsy moth and spruce budworm infestations which may recover within 1 or 2 years.
  * Spectral Decline - A plot where the spectral signal shows a trend in one or more of the spectral bands or indices (e.g. NDVI decreasing, Wetness decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.). Examples include cases where: a) non-forest/non-woody vegetation shows a trend suggestive of decline (e.g. NDVI decreasing, Wetness decreasing; SWIR increasing; etc.), or b) where woody vegetation shows a decline trend which is not related to the loss of woody vegetation, such as when mature tree canopies close resulting in increased shadowing, when species composition changes from conifer to hardwood, or when a dry period (as opposed to stronger, more acute drought) causes an apparent decline in vigor, but no loss of woody material or leaf area.

  
`Change_Raw_Probability_Fast-Loss` | Raw LCMS modeled probability of Fast Loss. Defined as: Fast Loss includes the following classes from the TimeSync change process interpretation-
  * Fire - Land altered by fire, regardless of the cause of the ignition (natural or anthropogenic), severity, or land use.
  * Harvest - Forest land where trees, shrubs or other vegetation have been severed or removed by anthropogenic means. Examples include clearcutting, salvage logging after fire or insect outbreaks, thinning and other forest management prescriptions (e.g. shelterwood/seedtree harvest).
  * Mechanical - Non-forest land where trees, shrubs or other vegetation has been mechanically severed or removed by chaining, scraping, brush sawing, bulldozing, or any other methods of non-forest vegetation removal.
  * Wind/ice - Land (regardless of use) where vegetation is altered by wind from hurricanes, tornados, storms and other severe weather events including freezing rain from ice storms.
  * Hydrology - Land where flooding has significantly altered woody cover or other Land cover elements regardless of land use (e.g. new mixtures of gravel and vegetation in and around streambeds after a flood).
  * Debris - Land (regardless of use) altered by natural material movement associated with landslides, avalanches, volcanos, debris flows, etc.
  * Other - Land (regardless of use) where the spectral trend or other supporting evidence suggests a disturbance or change event has occurred but the definitive cause cannot be determined or the type of change fails to meet any of the change process categories defined above.

  
`Change_Raw_Probability_Gain` | Raw LCMS modeled probability of Gain. Defined as: Land exhibiting an increase in vegetation cover due to growth and succession over one or more years. Applicable to any areas that may express spectral change associated with vegetation regrowth. In developed areas, growth can result from maturing vegetation and/or newly installed lawns and landscaping. In forests, growth includes vegetation growth from bare ground, as well as the over topping of intermediate and co-dominate trees and/or lower-lying grasses and shrubs. Growth/Recovery segments recorded following forest harvest will likely transition through different land cover classes as the forest regenerates. For these changes to be considered growth/recovery, spectral values should closely adhere to an increasing trend line (e.g. a positive slope that would, if extended to ~20 years, be on the order of .10 units of NDVI) which persists for several years.
