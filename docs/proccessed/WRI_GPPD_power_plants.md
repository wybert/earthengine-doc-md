The Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open source database of power plants around the world. It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare and draw insights. Each power plant is geolocated and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership, and fuel type. As of June 2018, the database includes around 28,500 power plants from 164 countries. It will be continuously updated as data becomes available.
The methodology for the dataset creation is given in the World Resources Institute publication ["A Global Database of Power Plants"](https://www.wri.org/publication/global-power-plant-database).
Associated code for the creation of the dataset can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/wri/global-power-plant-database). The bleeding-edge version of the database (which may contain substantial differences from the release in Earth Engine) is available on GitHub as well.
If you use this dataset, the provider (WRI) has requested that you [register your use](https://goo.gl/ivTvkd) and (optionally) sign up to receive update notifications.
