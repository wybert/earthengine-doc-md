Hurricane best track database (HURDAT2).
Atlantic basin 1851-2018.
**Table Schema**
Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
seq | DOUBLE | ATCF cyclone number for that year  
name | STRING | Hurricane name. e.g. "ALEX"  
datetime | STRING | Observation time in UTC. Format is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.  
record_id | STRING | Single letter desinating a specific event in a hurricane track. An empty string if no code.
  * C - Closest approach to a coast not followed by a landfall
  * G - Genesis
  * I - An intensity peak in terms of both pressure and wind
  * L - Landfall (center of system crossing a coastline)
  * P - Minimum in central pressure
  * R - Provides additional detail on the intensity of the cyclone when rapid changes are underway
  * S - Change of status of the system
  * T - Provides additional detail on the track (position) of the cyclone
  * W - Maximum sustained wind speed

  
status | STRING | Status of system:
  * DB - Disturbance (of any intensity)
  * ET - Unknown. The only occurrence is in HARVEY.
  * EX - Extratropical cyclone (of any intensity)
  * HU - Tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity (> 64 knots)
  * LO - A low that is neither a tropical cyclone, a subtropical cyclone, nor an extratropical cyclone (of any intensity)
  * SD - Subtropical cyclone of subtropical depression intensity (< 34 knots)
  * SS - Subtropical cyclone of subtropical storm intensity (> 34 knots)
  * TD - Tropical cyclone of tropical depression intensity (< 34 knots)
  * TS - Tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity (34-63 knots)
  * WV - Tropical Wave (of any intensity)

  
max_wind_kts | DOUBLE | Maximum wind speed  
min_pressure | DOUBLE | Minimum pressure  
numEntries | DOUBLE | Number of points for a particular hurricane  
radii_ne_34kt | DOUBLE | 34 kt wind radii maximum extent in northeastern quadrant  
radii_se_34kt | DOUBLE | 34 kt wind radii maximum extent in southeastern quadrant  
radii_sw_34kt | DOUBLE | 34 kt wind radii maximum extent in southwestern quadrant  
radii_nw_34kt | DOUBLE | 34 kt wind radii maximum extent in northwestern quadrant  
radii_ne_50kt | DOUBLE | 50 kt wind radii maximum extent in northeastern quadrant  
radii_se_50kt | DOUBLE | 50 kt wind radii maximum extent in southeastern quadrant  
radii_sw_50kt | DOUBLE | 50 kt wind radii maximum extent in southwestern quadrant  
radii_nw_50kt | DOUBLE | 50 kt wind radii maximum extent in northwestern quadrant  
radii_ne_64kt | DOUBLE | 64 kt wind radii maximum extent in northeastern quadrant  
radii_se_64kt | DOUBLE | 64 kt wind radii maximum extent in southeastern quadrant  
radii_sw_64kt | DOUBLE | 64 kt wind radii maximum extent in southwestern quadrant  
radii_nw_64kt | DOUBLE | 64 kt wind radii maximum extent in northwestern quadrant  
basin | STRING | Ocean basin. Always "AL" for Atlantic.  
id | STRING | Code for a particular hurricane. "AL" followed by a 2 digit cyclone number followed by a 4-digit year. e.g. "AL162018"  
year | DOUBLE | Year in which the hurricane occurred
