The Defense Meteorological Program (DMSP) Operational Line-Scan System (OLS) has a unique capability to detect visible and near-infrared (VNIR) emission sources at night.
This collection contains global nighttime lights images with no sensor saturation. The sensor is typically operated at a high-gain setting to enable the detection of moonlit clouds. However, with six bit quantization and limited dynamic range, the recorded data are saturated in the bright cores of urban centers. A limited set of observations at low lunar illumination were obtained where the gain of the detector was set significantly lower than its typical operational setting (sometimes by a factor of 100). Sparse data acquired at low-gain settings were combined with the operational data acquired at high-gain settings to produce the set of global nighttime lights images with no sensor saturation. Data from different satellites were merged and blended into the final product in order to gain maximum coverage. For more information, see this [readme](https://eogdata.mines.edu/dmsp/radcal_readme.txt) file from the provider.
