The Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) NASA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Land Cover Dynamics data product provides global land surface phenology (GLSP) metrics at yearly intervals. The VNP22Q2 data product is derived from time series of the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) calculated from VIIRS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Vegetation phenology metrics at 500 meter spatial resolution are identified for up to two detected growing cycles per year.
The product contains six phenological transition dates: onset of greenness increase, onset of greenness maximum, onset of greenness decrease, onset of greenness minimum, dates of mid-greenup, and senescence phases. The product also includes the growing season length. The greenness-related metrics consist of EVI2 onset of greenness increase, EVI2 onset of greenness maximum, EVI2 growing season, rate of greenness increase, and rate of greenness decrease. The confidence of phenology detection is provided as greenness agreement growing season, proportion of good quality (PGQ) growing season, PGQ onset greenness increase, PGQ onset greenness maximum, PGQ onset greenness decrease, and PGQ onset greenness minimum. The final layer is quality control specifying the overall quality of the product.
