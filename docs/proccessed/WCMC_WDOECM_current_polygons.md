A geographically defined area other than a Protected Area, which is governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained long-term outcomes for the in situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socio-economic, and other locally relevant values.
The WDOECM has two feature classes with associated spatial and tabular data. The World Database on Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (WDOECM) is a global repository of information on Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs). It is managed by the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) with support from the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).
**WDOECM User Manual.** For details including methodologies,standards, data providers, metadata field definitions and descriptions, refer to the [WDOECM User Manual](https://wdpa.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/WDPA_Manual/English/WDPA_WDOECM_Manual_1_6.pdf).
**Asset Naming Conventions.** WCMC updates the WDOECM on a monthly basis. The most recent version is always available as WCMC/WDOECM/current/polygons and WCMC/WDOECM/current/points. Historical versions, starting with May 2024, are available in the format WCMC/WDOECM/YYYYMM/polygons and WCMC/WDOECM/YYYYMM/points.
Please see the [WDOECM User Manual](https://wdpa.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/WDPA_Manual/English/WDPA_WDOECM_Manual_1_6.pdf) for additional details on the field list.
**Table Schema**
Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
CONS_OBJ | STRING | It refers to the primacy of conservation objectives. The field provides an indication of whether an OECM is managed with biodiversity conservation as a primary objective, secondary objective, or without conservation as an explicit objective.  
DESIG | STRING | Designation of the OECMs in the native language.  
DESIG_ENG | STRING | Designation of the protected area or OECM in English. If the original language is English, this field will contain the same value as DESIG. No fixed values for national-level designations.  
DESIG_TYPE | STRING | Designation type, one of: national, regional, international, or not applicable  
GIS_AREA | DOUBLE | Protected area total extent, including both marine (if applicable) and terrestrial areas, in square kilometers calculated by UNEP-WCMC projecting the protected area polygon in the standard Mollweide projection and using GIS software tools.  
GIS_M_AREA | DOUBLE | Protected area marine extent in square kilometers calculated by UNEP-WCMC projecting the protected area polygon in the standard Mollweide projection and using GIS software tools.  
GOV_TYPE | STRING | Description of the decision-making structure of a PA. One of: federal or national ministry or agency, sub-national ministry or agency, government-delegated management, transboundary governance, collaborative governance, joint governance, individual landowners, non-profit organizations, for-profit organizations, indigenous peoples, local communities, or not reported.  
INT_CRIT | STRING | International criteria, assigned by UNEP-WCMC. For World Heritage and Ramsar sites only.  
ISO3 | STRING | ISO3 Code. [ISO 3166-3 character code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-3) of the country or territory where the OECM is located.  
IUCN_CAT | STRING | IUCN management category, one of: Ia (strict nature reserve), Ib (wilderness area), II (national park), III (natural monument or feature), IV (habitat/species management area), V (protected landscape/seascape), VI (PA with sustainable use of natural resources), not applicable, not assigned, or not reported.  
MANG_AUTH | STRING | Management authority. Agency, organization, individual or group that manages the OECM.  
MANG_PLAN | STRING | Link or reference to the PAs management plan.  
MARINE | STRING | This field describes whether a PA falls totally or partially within the marine environment, one of: 0 (100% terrestrial PA), 1 (coastal: marine and terrestrial PA), or 2 (100% marine PA).  
METADATAID | INT | Metadata ID, assigned by UNEP-WCMC. Link to WDPA source table.  
NAME | STRING | Name of the OECM as provided by the data provider.  
NO_TAKE | STRING | No take means that the taking of living or dead natural resources, inclusive of all methods of fishing, extraction, dumping, dredging and construction, is strictly prohibited in all or part of a marine PA. This is only applicable to PAs where the field marine = 1 or 2. One of: all, part, none, not reported, or not applicable (if MARINE field = 0).  
NO_TK_AREA | DOUBLE | Area of the marine no-take area in square kilometers.  
ORIG_NAME | STRING | Name of the PA in the original language.  
OWN_TYPE | STRING | Ownership type, one of: state, communal, individual landowners, for-profit organizations, non-profit organizations, joint ownership, multiple ownership, contested, or not Reported.  
PARENT_ISO | STRING | Parent ISO3 code. [ISO 3166-3 character code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-3) of country where the PA is located.  
PA_DEF | STRING | PA definition. Whether this site meets the IUCN and/or CBD definition of a PA: 1=yes, 0=no (currently stored outside WDPA).  
REP_AREA | DOUBLE | The total OECMs extent, including both marine (if applicable) and terrestrial areas, in square kilometers provided by data provider as specified in the legal text for the site.  
REP_M_AREA | DOUBLE | Marine area in square kilometers provided by the data provider.  
STATUS | STRING | Status of a PA, one of: proposed, inscribed, adopted, designated, or established.  
STATUS_YR | INT | Year of enactment of status in the STATUS field.  
SUB_LOC | STRING | Sub-national location. [ISO 3166-2 sub-national code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) where the PA is located. If the PA is in more than one state, province, region etc., multiple ISO-3166-2 codes can be listed separated by a comma and space.  
SUPP_INFO | STRING | Supplementary information supporting the categorization of the site as an OECM.  
VERIF | STRING | Verification status, assigned by UNEP-WCMC. One of: state verified, expert verified, not reported (for unverified data that was already in the WDPA prior to the inclusion of the ''Verification'' field).  
WDPAID | DOUBLE | Unique identifier for a protected area (PA), assigned by UNEP-WCMC.  
WDPA_PID | STRING | Unique identifier for parcels or zones within a PA, assigned by UNEP-WCMC.
