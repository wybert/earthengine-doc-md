GRACE Tellus Monthly Mass Grids provides monthly gravitational anomalies relative to a 2004-2010 time-mean baseline. The data contained in this dataset are units of "Equivalent Water Thickness" which represent the deviations of mass in terms of vertical extent of water in centimeters. See the provider's [Monthly Mass Grids Overview](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/monthly-mass-grids/) for more details.
The GRACE Tellus (GRCTellus) Monthly Mass Grids Ocean dataset is produced by three centers: CSR (U. Texas / Center for Space Research), GFZ (GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam), and JPL (NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory). Each center is a part of the GRACE Ground System and generates Level-2 data (spherical harmonic fields) used in this dataset. The output includes spherical harmonic coefficients of the gravity field and of the dealiasing fields used to compute them. Since each center independently produces the coefficients, the results may be slightly different. It is recommended for most users to use the mean of all three datasets. See the provider's [choosing a solution](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/choosing-a-solution/) page for more details.
**Note**
  * Land leakage correction: Ocean signals are typically weaker than land signals, by factors of 2 and more, on seasonal and interannual time scales. To minimize leakage from high land signals onto ocean signals, a destriping filter has been applied which may cause cause correlations over much larger distances.
  * The GRCTellus Ocean datasets are optimized to examine regional ocean bottom pressure, but NOT intended to be spatially averaged to determine global mean ocean mass.
