Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) is an international initiative with the goal of repeatedly surveying the world's estimated 200,000 glaciers.
The project seeks to create a globally comprehensive inventory of land ice, including measurements of glacier area, geometry, surface velocity, and snow line elevation. To perform these analyses, the GLIMS project uses satellite data, primarily from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), as well as historical information derived from maps and aerial photographs.
Each feature in this dataset is a polygonal boundary of a glacier at the time of analysis. A few glacier IDs have hundreds of distinct rows over time.
This dataset is a snapshot of the inventory of glacier boundaries as of June 7, 2023, providing over 1,100,000 rows.
