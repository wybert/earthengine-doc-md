The [Allen Coral Atlas](https://allencoralatlas.org/) dataset maps the geomorphic zonation and benthic habitat for the world's shallow coral reefs at 5 m pixel resolution. Also included is a global reef extent product that maps additional reef areas unable to be explicitly included in the geomorphic and benthic mapping. The underlying satellite image data are temporal composites of [PlanetScope satellite](https://www.planet.com/products/basemap/) imagery spanning 2018-2020. The habitat maps are created via a machine learning approach with contextual editing, using a range of imagery, bathymetry and derived products as input data, trained via a globally consistent reference data set. A full description of the methods and approaches can be found in the methods section of the [Allen Coral Atlas website](https://allencoralatlas.org/methods/).
The first version ([v1.0](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ACA_reef_habitat_v1_0)) of the Allen Coral Atlas was completed in Q4 2021, and this new version (v2.0) has a wide range of improvements across the globe that incorporated both user feedback on v1.0 and new technical developments in mapping methodology. A brief overview of the changes can be found [here](https://allencoralatlas.org/blog/geomorphic-and-benthic-maps-2022-update/) and a more comprehensive technical summary can be found [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/coral-atlas-static-files/resources-page-materials/Allen_Coral_Atlas_2022_habitat_map_revisions.pdf).
The Allen Coral Atlas was funded by [Vulcan Inc.](https://vulcan.com/) and is managed by the [Arizona State University Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science](https://gdcs.asu.edu/). Partners include [Planet](https://www.planet.com/), the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), and the [Coral Reef Alliance](https://coral.org/en/).

**Pixel Size** 5 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Description  
---|---  
`geomorphic` | Classification of geomorphic zonation.  
`benthic` | Classification of dominant benthic composition.  
`reef_mask` | Globally standardised reef extent product that integrates a number of global reef classification and bahtymetry products ("Reef Extent" on the Atlas portal).  
**geomorphic Class Table**
Value | Color | Description  
---|---|---  
0 | #000000 | Unmapped  
11 | #77d0fc | Shallow Lagoon - Shallow Lagoon is any closed to semi-enclosed, sheltered, flat-bottomed shallow sediment-dominated lagoon area.   
12 | #2ca2f9 | Deep Lagoon - Deep Lagoon is any sheltered broad body of water semi-enclosed to enclosed by reef, with a variable depth (but shallower than surrounding ocean) and a soft bottom dominated by reef-derived sediment.   
13 | #c5a7cb | Inner Reef Flat - Inner Reef Flat is a low energy, sediment-dominated, horizontal to gently sloping platform behind the Outer Reef Flat.   
14 | #92739d | Outer Reef Flat - Adjacent to the seaward edge of the reef, Outer Reef Flat is a level (near horizontal), broad and shallow platform that displays strong wave-driven zonation   
15 | #614272 | Reef Crest - Reef Crest is a zone marking the boundary between the reef flat and the reef slope, generally shallow and characterized by highest wave energy absorbance.   
16 | #fbdefb | Terrestrial Reef Flat - Terrestrial Reef Flat is a broad, flat, shallow to semi-exposed area of fringing reef found directly attached to land at one side, and subject to freshwater run-off, nutrients and sediment.
