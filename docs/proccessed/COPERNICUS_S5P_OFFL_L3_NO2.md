### OFFL/L3_NO2
This dataset provides offline high-resolution imagery of NO2 concentrations.
Nitrogen oxides (NO2 and NO) are important trace gases in the Earth's atmosphere, present in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. They enter the atmosphere as a result of anthropogenic activities (notably fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning) and natural processes (wildfires, lightning, and microbiological processes in soils). Here, NO2 is used to represent concentrations of collective nitrogen oxides because during daytime, i.e. in the presence of sunlight, a photochemical cycle involving ozone (O3) converts NO into NO2 and vice versa on a timescale of minutes. The TROPOMI NO2 processing system is based on the algorithm developments for the DOMINO-2 product and for the EU QA4ECV NO2 reprocessed dataset for OMI, and has been adapted for TROPOMI. This retrieval-assimilation-modelling system uses the 3-dimensional global TM5-MP chemistry transport model at a resolution of 1x1 degree as an essential element.

### OFFL L3 Product
To make our OFFL L3 products, we find areas within the product's bounding box with data using a command like this:
```
harpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9
-a 'tropospheric_NO2_column_number_density_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time})'
S5P_OFFL_L2__NO2____20181010T074409_20181010T092539_05135_01_010100_20181016T092316.nc
grid_info.h5

```

We then merge all the data into one large mosaic (area-averaging values for pixels that may have different values for different times). From the mosaic, we create a set of tiles containing orthorectified raster data.
Example harpconvert invocation for one tile: `harpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9 -a 'tropospheric_NO2_column_number_density_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time}); bin_spatial(2001, 50.000000, 0.01, 2001, -120.000000, 0.01); keep(NO2_column_number_density,tropospheric_NO2_column_number_density,    stratospheric_NO2_column_number_density,NO2_slant_column_number_density,    tropopause_pressure,absorbing_aerosol_index,cloud_fraction,    sensor_altitude,sensor_azimuth_angle,    sensor_zenith_angle,solar_azimuth_angle,solar_zenith_angle)' S5P_OFFL_L2__NO2____20181010T074409_20181010T092539_05135_01_010100_20181016T092316.nc output.h5`
### Sentinel-5 Precursor
Sentinel-5 Precursor is a satellite launched on 13 October 2017 by the European Space Agency to monitor air pollution. The onboard sensor is frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).
All of the S5P datasets, except CH4, have two versions: Near Real-Time (NRTI) and Offline (OFFL). CH4 is available as OFFL only. The NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL assets, but appear more quickly after acquisition. The OFFL assets contain data from a single orbit (which, due to half the earth being dark, contains data only for a single hemisphere).
Because of noise in the data, negative vertical column values are often observed in particular over clean regions or for low SO2 emissions. It is recommended not to filter these values except for outliers, i.e. for vertical columns lower than -0.001 mol/m^2.
The original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned by time, not by latitude/longitude. To make it possible to ingest the data into Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping a single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products is performed).
Source products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine assets, with suffixes _1 and _2.
The conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html) tool using the `bin_spatial` operation. The source data is filtered to remove pixels with QA values less than:
  * 80% for AER_AI
  * 75% for the tropospheric_NO2_column_number_density band of NO2
  * 50% for all other datasets except for O3 and SO2


The O3_TCL product is ingested directly (without running harpconvert).
