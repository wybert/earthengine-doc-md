A newer version of this dataset with 4 classes for 2017-2020 can be found in [JAXA/ALOS/PALSAR/YEARLY/FNF4](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JAXA_ALOS_PALSAR_YEARLY_FNF4)
The global forest/non-forest map (FNF) is generated by classifying the SAR image (backscattering coefficient) in the global 25m resolution PALSAR-2/PALSAR SAR mosaic so that strong and low backscatter pixels are assigned as "forest" and "non-forest", respectively. Here, "forest" is defined as the natural forest with the area larger than 0.5 ha and forest cover over 10%. This definition is the same as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) definition. Since the radar backscatter from the forest depends on the region (climate zone), the classification of Forest/Non-Forest is conducted by using a region-dependent threshold of backscatter. The classification accuracy is checked by using in-situ photos and high-resolution optical satellite images. Detailed information is available in the provider's [Dataset Description](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/DatasetDescription_PALSAR2_Mosaic_FNF_revE.pdf).
Attention:
  * Backscatter values may vary significantly from path to path over high latitude forest areas. This is due to the change of backscattering intensity caused by freezing trees in winter. Please note that this may affect the classification of forest/non-forest.
