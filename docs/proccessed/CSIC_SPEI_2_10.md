The Global SPEI database (SPEIbase) offers long-time robust information about drought conditions at the global scale, with a 0.5 degree pixel size and monthly cadence. It provides SPEI time scales from 1 to 48 months.
The Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) expresses, as a standardized variate (mean zero and unit variance), the deviations of the current climatic balance (precipitation minus evapotranspiration potential) with respect to the long-term balance. The reference period for the calculation in the SPEIbase corresponds to the whole study period. Being a standardized variate means that the SPEI condition can be compared across space and time.
The SPEIbase is based on the [FAO-56 Penman-Monteith estimation](https://www.fao.org/3/x0490e/x0490e06.htm) estimation of potential evapotranspiration. This is a major difference with respect to the SPEI Global Drought Monitor, that uses the Thornthwaite PET estimation. The Penman-Monteith method is considered a superior method, so the SPEIbase is recommended for most uses including long-term climatological analysis.
