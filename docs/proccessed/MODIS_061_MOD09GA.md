The MODIS Surface Reflectance products provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance as it would be measured at ground level in the absence of atmospheric scattering or absorption. Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols. MOD09GA version 6.1 provides bands 1-7 in a daily gridded L2G product in the sinusoidal projection, including 500m reflectance values and 1km observation and geolocation statistics.
