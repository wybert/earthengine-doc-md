Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) provides a global hourly rain rate with a 0.1 x 0.1 degree resolution. GSMaP is a product of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, which provides global precipitation observations at three hour intervals. Values are estimated using multi-band passive microwave and infrared radiometers from the GPM Core Observatory satellite and with the assistance of a constellation of other satellites. GPM's precipitation rate retrieval algorithm is based on a radiative transfer model. The gauge-adjusted rate is calculated based on the optimization of the 24h accumulation of GSMaP hourly rain rate to daily precipitation by NOAA/CPC gauge measurement. This dataset is processed by GSMaP algorithm version 8 (product version 5). See [GSMaP Technical Documentation](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/GPM/doc/product/format/en/07.GPM_GSMaP_Product_Format_V5_E.pdf) for more details.
This dataset contains provisional products GSMaP_NRT that are regularly replaced with updated versions when the GSMaP_MVK data become available. The products are marked with a metadata property called ''status''. When a product is initially made available, the property value is ''provisional''. Once a provisional product has been updated with the final version, this value is updated to ''permanent''. For more information please refer [General Documentation](https://eolp.jaxa.jp/GSMaP_Hourly.html)
