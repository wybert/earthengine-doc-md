ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset. ERA5 replaces its predecessor, the ERA-Interim reanalysis.
ERA5 MONTHLY provides aggregated values for each month for seven ERA5 climate reanalysis parameters: 2m air temperature, 2m dewpoint temperature, total precipitation, mean sea level pressure, surface pressure, 10m u-component of wind and 10m v-component of wind. Additionally, monthly minimum and maximum air temperature at 2m has been calculated based on the hourly 2m air temperature data. Monthly total precipitation values are given as monthly sums. All other parameters are provided as monthly averages.
ERA5 data is available from 1940 to three months from real-time, the version in the EE Data Catalog is available from 1979. More information and more ERA5 atmospheric parameters can be found at the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview).
Provider's Note: Monthly aggregates have been calculated based on the ERA5 hourly values of each parameter.
