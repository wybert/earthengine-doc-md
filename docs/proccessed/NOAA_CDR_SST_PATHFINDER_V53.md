The AVHRR Pathfinder Version 5.3 Sea Surface Temperature dataset (PFV53) is a collection of global, twice-daily 4km sea surface temperature data produced in a partnership by the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center and the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. PFV53 was computed from data from the AVHRR instruments on board NOAA's polar orbiting satellite series using an entirely modernized system based on SeaDAS. PFV53 data are nearly 100% compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification Version 2.0 for L3C products and only deviate from that standard in that 'sses_bias', 'sses_standard_deviation', and 'sst_dtime' variables are empty and hence not included into EE assets. PFV53 data were collected through the operational periods of the NOAA-7 through NOAA-19 Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES), and are available from 1981 to 2014. Additional information is available at the [NOAA Pathfinder site](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/satellitedata/pathfinder4km53/).
Additional band details can be found in the [Tech Specs](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/sds/cdr/CDRs/Sea_Surface_Temperature_Pathfinder/AlgorithmDescription_01B-08.pdf) page.
These data were provided by GHRSST and the US NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). This project was supported in part by a grant from the NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) Program for satellites.
**Pixel Size** 4000 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Scale | Offset | Description  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
`sea_surface_temperature` | K |  -300*  |  3999*  | 0.01 | 273.15 | Skin temperature of the ocean  
`dt_analysis` | K |  -127*  |  127*  | 0.1 | The difference between this SST and the previous day's.  
`wind_speed` | m/s |  0*  |  47*  | These wind speeds were created by NCEP-DOE Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP-II) reanalysis (R-2) and represent winds at 10 meters above the sea surface.  
`sea_ice_fraction` |  8*  |  100*  | 0.01 | Sea ice concentration data are taken from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) [Global Daily Sea Ice Concentration Reprocessing Data Set accession.nodc.noaa.gov/0068294](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/global-daily-sea-ice-concentration-reprocessing-data-set-for-1978-2007-from-the-eumetsat-ocean-) when these data are available. The data are reprojected and interpolated from their original polar stereographic projection at 10km spatial resolution to the 4km Pathfinder Version 5.3 grid. When the OSISAF data are not available for both hemispheres on a given day, the sea ice concentration data are taken from the sea_ice_fraction variable found in the L4 GHRSST DailyOI SST product from NOAA/NCDC, and are interpolated from the 25km DailyOI grid to the 4km Pathfinder Version 5.3 grid.  
`aerosol_dynamic_indicator` |  -127*  |  127*  | 0.01 | 1.1 | Aerosol optical thickness (100 KM) data are taken from the CLASS AERO100 products, which are created from AVHRR channel 1 optical thickness retrievals from AVHRR global area coverage (GAC) data. The aerosol optical thickness measurements are interpolated from their original 1 degree x 1 degree resolution to the 4km Pathfinder Version 5.3 grid.  
`quality_level` |  0  |  5  | Note, the native Pathfinder processing system returns quality levels ranging from 0 to 7 (7 is best quality; -1 represents missing data) and has been converted to the extent possible into the six levels required by the GDS2 (ranging from 0 to 5, where 5 is best). Below is the conversion table:
  * GDS2 required quality_level 5 = native Pathfinder quality level 7 == best_quality
  * GDS2 required quality_level 4 = native Pathfinder quality level 4-6 == acceptable_quality
  * GDS2 required quality_level 3 = native Pathfinder quality level 2-3 == low_quality
  * GDS2 required quality_level 2 = native Pathfinder quality level 1 == worst_quality
  * GDS2 required quality_level 1 = native Pathfinder quality level 0 = bad_data
  * GDS2 required quality_level 0 = native Pathfinder quality level -1 = missing_data

The original Pathfinder quality level is recorded in the optional variable pathfinder_quality_level.  
`pathfinder_quality_level` |  0  |  7  | The native Pathfinder processing system quality levels, ranging from 0 to 7, where 0 is worst and 7 is best.  
`l2p_flags` | Used to specify the type of input SST data and pass through native flags from the input L2 SST data set.  
Bitmask for l2p_flags
  * Bit 0: Type of input SST data. 
    * 0: Always set to zero to indicate infrared data.
  * Bit 1: Land 
    * 0: Input pixel is classified as over ocean.
    * 1: Pixel area is >= 50% land as determined by rasterizing the Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Shoreline (GSHHS) Database from the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center.
  * Bit 2: Sea ice fraction 
    * 0: 'sea_ice_fraction' is less than 0.15.
    * 1: 'sea_ice_fraction' is 0.15 or greater.
  * Bit 3: Lake 
    * 0: Pixel area is < 50% lake covered.
    * 1: Pixel area is >= 50% lake covered as determined from rasterizing US World Wildlife Fund's Global Lakes and Wetlands Database.
  * Bit 4: River 
    * 0: Pixel area is < 50% river covered.
    * 1: Pixel area is >= 50% river covered as determined form rasterizing US World Wildlife Fund's Global Lakes and Wetlands Database.
