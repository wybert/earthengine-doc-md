The United States Census Bureau regularly releases a geodatabase named TIGER. This dataset contains the 2010 census blocks, roughly equivalent to a city block. There are just over 11 million polygon features covering the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the [Island areas](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2010/dec/2010-island-areas.html).
For full technical details on all TIGER 2010 products, see the [TIGER technical documentation](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2010/TGRSHP10SF1.pdf).
**Table Schema**

---|---|---  
blockce | STRING | 2010 Census tabulation block number  
blockid10 | STRING | Block identifier: a concatenation of 2010 Census state Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, county FIPS code, census tract code, and tabulation block number  
countyfp10 | STRING | County FIPS code  
housing10 | DOUBLE | 2010 Census number of housing units  
partflg | STRING | Partial block flag  
pop10 | DOUBLE | Population total as of 2010 census  
statefp10 | STRING | 2010 Census state FIPS code  
tractce10 | STRING | 2010 Census tract code
