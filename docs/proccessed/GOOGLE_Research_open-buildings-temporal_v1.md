The Open Buildings 2.5D Temporal Dataset contains data about building presence, fractional building counts, and building heights at an effective1 spatial resolution of 4m (rasters are provided at 0.5m resolution) at an annual cadence from 2016-2023. It is produced from open-source, low-resolution imagery from the [Sentinel-2](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2) collection.
The dataset is available across Africa, South Asia, South-East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The goal of this data is to support organizations (e.g., governmental, non-profits, commercial) focusing on a range of applications for social good.
Explore the data interactively with the demo Earth Engine [app](https://goo.gle/open-buildings-temporal-demo-app). (In case you encounter performance issues with the Earth Engine app please try [this](https://goo.gle/open-buildings-temporal-demo) Earth Engine script instead.)
Alternatively, if you are not an Earth Engine user, you can download the data directly from Google Cloud Storage using [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/google-research/blob/master/building_detection/open_buildings_temporal_download_region_geotiffs.ipynb).

**Pixel Size** 4 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
`building_fractional_count` |  0  |  0.0216  | Source data for deriving building counts for a given AOI. Please see accompanying example scripts.  
`building_height` | m |  0  |  100  | Building height relative to the terrain in range [0m, 100m].  
`building_presence` |  0  |  1  | Model confidence values (i.e. how confident a model is that the pixel is part of a building) in range [0.0, 1.0]. Note that model confidence values are uncalibrated, meaning, if model confidence for a certain pixel is 0.8, it doesn't mean the actual likelihood of building presence is 80%. As such, confidence values can only be used for relative ranking (eg. thresholding) of pixels. Also, the model confidence can vary across location and time based on a number of factors such as cloud cover, imagery misalignment, etc.  
**Image Properties**
Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
imagery_start_time_epoch_s | DOUBLE | Oldest possible date for source Sentinel-2 imagery used to produce these rasters.  
imagery_end_time_epoch_s | DOUBLE | Newest possible date for source Sentinel-2 imagery used to produce these rasters.  
inference_time_epoch_s | DOUBLE | Time the rasters are supposed to predict the state of the world for, in seconds since epoch.  
s2cell_token | STRING | Token of the S2 cell this tile belongs to. Due to UTM zone boundaries, a single S2 cell that spans multiple zones may have multiple corresponding tiles in different projection zones. See <http://s2geometry.io/>.
