Global high-resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are a prerequisite for the accurate measurement of the impacts of population growth, for monitoring changes, and for planning interventions. The WorldPop project aims to meet these needs through the provision of detailed and open access population distribution datasets built using transparent and peer-reviewed approaches.
Full details on the methods and datasets used in constructing the data, along with open access publications, are provided on the [WorldPop website](https://www.worldpop.org/). In brief, recent census-based population counts matched to their associated administrative units are disaggregated to ~100x100m grid cells through machine learning approaches that exploit the relationships between population densities and a range of geospatial covariate layers. The mapping approach is Random Forest-based dasymetric redistribution.
This dataset contains top-down constrained breakdown of estimated population by age and gender groups. Currently only 2020 data are present.
Top-down constrained age/sex structure estimate datasets for individual countries for 2020 at 100m spatial resolution with country totals adjusted to match the corresponding official United Nations population estimates that have been prepared by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat ([2019 Revision of World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Files/1_Indicators%20\(Standard\)/EXCEL_FILES/1_Population/WPP2019_POP_F01_1_TOTAL_POPULATION_BOTH_SEXES.xlsx)).
[See explanation of constrained vs unconstrained datasets](https://www.worldpop.org/methods/top_down_constrained_vs_unconstrained).
Further WorldPop gridded datasets on population age structures, poverty, urban growth, and population dynamics are freely available on the WorldPop website. WorldPop represents a collaboration between researchers at the University of Southampton, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, and University of Louisville. The project is principally funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
