The MOD09Q1 product provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of bands 1 and 2 at 250m resolution and corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the two reflectance bands, a quality layer is also included. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite on the basis of high observation coverage, low view angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading.
