This dataset, part of the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program, consists of mean monthly velocity maps for selected glacier outlet areas. The maps are generated by tracking visible features between optical image pairs acquired by the Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER).
**Note**
Monthly means are calculated from images, which may have acquisition dates from the preceding or succeeding month. For the naming convention, the month is determined from where the midpoint Julian dates fall. For example, September monthly means may have been generated from images that were acquired in August or in October but the midpoint Julian date between the images falls within September. The exact dates used are included as per-image metadata fields.
