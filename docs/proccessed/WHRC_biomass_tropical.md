A national-level map of above-ground live woody biomass density for tropical countries at 500m. This dataset was assembled from a combination of co-located field measurements, LiDAR observations, and imagery recorded from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).
**Pixel Size** 500 meters
