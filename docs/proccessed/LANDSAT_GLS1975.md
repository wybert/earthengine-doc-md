The Global Land Survey (GLS) 1975 is a global collection of imagery from the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS). Most scenes were acquired by Landsat 1-3 in 1972-1983. A few gaps in the Landsat 1-3 data have been filled with scenes acquired by Landsat 4-5 during the years 1982-1987. These data contain 4 spectral bands: Green, Red, an NIR band, and a SWIR band. In the typical False-color presentation, the images appear red because the NIR band, displayed as red, highlights vegetation.
**Pixel Size** 60 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Wavelength | Description  
---|---|---  
`10` | 500-600 nm | Green  
`20` | 600-700 nm | Red  
`30` | 700-800 nm | Near infrared  
`40` | 800-1100 nm | Short-wavelength infrared
