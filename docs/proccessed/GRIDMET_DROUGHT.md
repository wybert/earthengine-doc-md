This dataset contains drought indices derived from the 4-km daily Gridded Surface Meteorological (GRIDMET) dataset. The drought indices provided include the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the evaporative drought demand index (EDDI), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Palmer Z Index (Z).
SPI, EDDI, and SPEI are supplied on different time scales corresponding to the time aggregation of precipitation, reference evapotranspiration, and precipitation minus reference evapotranspiration, respectively. The time scales include 14 day, 30 day, 90 day, 180 day, 270 day, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years. The standardization is done by using a non-parametric standardized probability based method where plotting positions are used to obtain probabilities which are transformed to indices assuming an inverse-normal distribution. All data are standardized over a common time period of 1981-2016.
PDSI and Z are calculated using a modified version of the Palmer formula which uses reference evapotranspiration and precipitation from GRIDMET, and a static soil water holding capacity layer (top 1500mm) from STATSGO. Modifications to the coefficients of the original Palmer formula are applied to calculate PDSI. The baseline period for PDSI and Z calculations is 1979-2018.
Interpretation of the drought indices in this dataset is different for PDSI and Z than for SPI, SPEI and EDDI. Utilizing the interpretation from the US Drought monitor, values of these drought indices have the following meaning:
PDSI and z:
  * 5.0 or more (extremely wet)
  * 4.0 to 4.99 (very wet)
  * 3.0 to 3.99 (moderately wet),
  * 2.0 to 2.99 (slightly wet)
  * 1.0 to 1.99 (incipient wet spell)
  * -0.99 to 0.99(near normal)
  * -1.99 to -1.00 (incipient dry spell)
  * -2.99 to -2.00 (mild drought)
  * -3.99 to -3.00 (moderate drought)
  * -4.99 to -4.00 (severe drought)
  * -5.0 or less (extreme drought)


SPI/SPEI/EDDI:
  * 2.0 or more (extremely wet)
  * 1.6 to 1.99 (very wet)
  * 1.3 to 1.59 (moderately wet),
  * 0.8 to 1.29 (slightly wet)
  * 0.5 to 0.79 (incipient wet spell)
  * -0.49 to 0.49(near normal),
  * -0.79 to -0.5 (incipient dry spell)
  * -1.29 to -0.8 (mild drought)
  * -1.59 to -1.3 (moderate drought)
  * -1.99 to -1.6 (severe drought)
  * -2.0 or less (extreme drought).


This dataset contains provisional products that are replaced with updated versions when the complete source data become available. Products can be distinguished by the value of the 'status' property. At first, assets are ingested with status='early'. After several days, they are replaced by assets with status='provisional'. After about 2 months, they are replaced by the final assets with status='permanent'.
