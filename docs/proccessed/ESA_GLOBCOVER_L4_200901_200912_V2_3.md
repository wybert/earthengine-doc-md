GlobCover 2009 is a global land cover map based on ENVISAT's Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) Level 1B data acquired in full resolution mode with a spatial resolution of approximately 300 meters.
**Pixel Size** 300 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Description  
---|---  
`landcover` | The land cover map is derived by an automatic and regionally-tuned classification of a time series of global MERIS FR mosaics for the year 2009. The global land cover map counts 22 land cover classes defined with the United Nations (UN) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS).  
`qa` | Binary quality band indicating whether the reference dataset has been used instead of the output of the GlobCover classification scheme.  
Bitmask for qa
  * Bit 0: Information on dataset used for classification 
    * 0: Areas classified using the output of the GlobCover classification scheme.
    * 1: Areas classified using the reference dataset.
