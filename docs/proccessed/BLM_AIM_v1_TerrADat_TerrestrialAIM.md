Since 2011, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has collected field information to inform land health through its Assessment Inventory and Monitoring (AIM) strategy. To date, more than 6,000 terrestrial AIM field plots have been collected over BLM lands. The BLM AIM data archive is updated annually. Standardized core indicators are collected at each plot that are known to be both ecologically relevant and clearly tied to rangeland health. These indicators inform biotic integrity, soil and site stability, and hydrologic function. The terrestrial plot measurements include fractional bare ground cover, vegetation composition and height, plants of management concern, non-native invasive species, plant canopy gaps, species richness, and soil aggregate stability. AIM represents one of the most extensive publicly available plot measurement datasets across Western US federal lands, which can be integrated with remotely sensed imagery and other geospatial information for a range of analysis, classification, and validation purposes.
This dataset was created to monitor the status, condition and trend of national BLM resources in accordance with BLM policies. The methodology used for the collection of these data can be found on [the Landscape Toolbox](https://landscapetoolbox.org) and the Monitoring Manual, 2nd Edition. These data should not be used for statistical or spatial inferences without knowledge of how the sample design was drawn or without calculating spatial weights for the points based on the sample design.
This feature class includes monitoring data collected nationally to understand the status, condition, and trend of resources on BLM lands. Data are collected in accordance with the BLM Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) Strategy. The AIM Strategy specifies a probabilistic sampling design, standard core indicators and methods, electronic data capture and management, and integration with remote sensing. Attributes include the BLM terrestrial core indicators: bare ground, vegetation composition, plant species of management concern, non-native invasive species, and percent canopy gaps (see Entity/Attribute Section for exact details on attributes). Data were collected and managed by BLM Field Offices, BLM Districts, and/or affiliated field crews with support from the BLM National Operations Center. Data are stored in a centralized database (TerrADat) at the BLM National Operations Center.
Data were collected by trained data collectors with the BLM and partner organizations. They followed the BLM core terrestrial data [collection protocols](https://www.ntc.blm.gov/krc/viewresource.php?courseID=281&programAreaId=148). Data were captured electronically using the [Database for Inventory, Monitoring, and Assessment](https://jornada.nmsu.edu/tools/dima). They were managed by the data collectors, with oversight from BLM field offices, state offices, and the National Operations Center. This dataset has undergone rigorous QA/QC to ensure data quality.
