This dataset identifies water pixels; non-water pixels are masked. The water mask was used to exclude areas of water and permanent ice from the population allocation.
[General Documentation](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-basic-demographic-characteristics-rev11/docs)
The Gridded Population of World Version 4 (GPWv4), Revision 11 models the distribution of global human population for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 on 30 arc-second (approximately 1 km) grid cells. Population is distributed to cells using proportional allocation of population from census and administrative units. Population input data are collected at the most detailed spatial resolution available from the results of the 2010 round of censuses, which occurred between 2005 and 2014. The input data are extrapolated to produce population estimates for each modeled year.
