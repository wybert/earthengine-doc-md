#### Description
The EMIT Project is part of the Earth Venture-Instrument (EV-I) Program directed by the Program Director of the NASA Earth Science Division (ESD). EMIT is comprised of a VSWIR Infrared Dyson imaging spectrometer adapted for installation on the International Space Station (ISS). EMIT measures radiance between 380 and 2500 nanometers, with an approximate 7 nm bandpass. Data are collected in a swath that is approximately 75 km wide at the equator, with an approximate ground sampling distance of 60 m. See the provider's [NASA EMIT Overview](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1695/EMIT_L2B_GHG_User_Guide_V1.pdf) for more details.
EMIT was a particularly useful tool for mapping out greenhouse gases, including methane, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. This is consistent with previous findings from airborne data, but global nature, revisit frequency and wide swath of EMIT provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate greenhouse gas retrievals.
The EMIT Level 2B Estimated Methane Plume Complexes (EMITL2BCH4PLM) Version 1 data product provides estimated methane plume complexes in parts per million meter (ppm m) along with uncertainty data. The EMITL2BCH4PLM data product will only be generated where methane plume complexes have been identified.
