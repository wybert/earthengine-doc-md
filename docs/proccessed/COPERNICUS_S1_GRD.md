The Sentinel-1 mission provides data from a dual-polarization C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument at 5.405GHz (C band). This collection includes the S1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) scenes, processed using the Sentinel-1 Toolbox to generate a calibrated, ortho-corrected product. The collection is updated daily. New assets are ingested within two days after they become available.
This collection contains all of the GRD scenes. Each scene has one of 3 resolutions (10, 25 or 40 meters), 4 band combinations (corresponding to scene polarization) and 3 instrument modes. Use of the collection in a mosaic context will likely require filtering down to a homogeneous set of bands and parameters. See [this article](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/sentinel1) for details of collection use and preprocessing. Each scene contains either 1 or 2 out of 4 possible polarization bands, depending on the instrument's polarization settings. The possible combinations are single band VV, single band HH, dual band VV+VH, and dual band HH+HV:
  1. VV: single co-polarization, vertical transmit/vertical receive
  2. HH: single co-polarization, horizontal transmit/horizontal receive
  3. VV + VH: dual-band cross-polarization, vertical transmit/horizontal receive
  4. HH + HV: dual-band cross-polarization, horizontal transmit/vertical receive


Each scene also includes an additional 'angle' band that contains the approximate incidence angle from ellipsoid in degrees at every point. This band is generated by interpolating the 'incidenceAngle' property of the 'geolocationGridPoint' gridded field provided with each asset.
Each scene was pre-processed with [Sentinel-1 Toolbox](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/toolboxes/sentinel-1) using the following steps:
  1. Thermal noise removal
  2. Radiometric calibration
  3. Terrain correction using SRTM 30 or ASTER DEM for areas greater than 60 degrees latitude, where SRTM is not available. The final terrain-corrected values are converted to decibels via log scaling (10*log10(x)).


For more information about these pre-processing steps, please refer to the [Sentinel-1 Pre-processing article](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/sentinel1). For further advice on working with Sentinel-1 imagery, see [Guido Lemoine's tutorial on SAR basics](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/sar-basics) and [Mort Canty's tutorial on SAR change detection](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/detecting-changes-in-sentinel-1-imagery-pt-1).
This collection is computed on-the-fly. If you want to use the underlying collection with raw power values (which is updated faster), see COPERNICUS/S1_GRD_FLOAT.
