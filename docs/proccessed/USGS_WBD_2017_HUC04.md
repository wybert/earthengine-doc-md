The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a comprehensive aggregated collection of hydrologic unit (HU) data consistent with the national criteria for delineation and resolution. It defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point except in coastal or lake front areas where there could be multiple outlets as stated by the [Federal Standards and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/11/a3). Watershed boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. The intent of defining HUs for the WBD is to establish a baseline drainage boundary framework, accounting for all land and surface areas.
The HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). WBDs are represented as polygons that define the boundary of the HUs. The HUs are given a Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) that ranges from 2 digits to 12 digits. These codes describe where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit. The number of digits in a HUC is related to 6 levels of detail for the WBD: the lower level polygons cover larger areas than higher level ones. The higher the level, the more digits to the HUC, since previous levels are nested in it.
The WBD polygons attributes include HUCs, size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream HUC, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. WBD line attributes contain the highest level of hydrologic unit for each boundary, line source information and flow modifications.
