This dataset represents the Census data source used to produce the GPW v4.11 populations estimates. Pixels that have the same value reflect the same data source, most often a country or territory.
[General Documentation](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-national-identifier-grid-rev11/docs)
The Gridded Population of World Version 4 (GPWv4), Revision 11 models the distribution of global human population for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 on 30 arc-second (approximately 1 km) grid cells. Population is distributed to cells using proportional allocation of population from census and administrative units. Population input data are collected at the most detailed spatial resolution available from the results of the 2010 round of censuses, which occurred between 2005 and 2014. The input data are extrapolated to produce population estimates for each modeled year.
