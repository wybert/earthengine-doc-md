GEDI's Level 2A Geolocated Elevation and Height Metrics Product (GEDI02_A) is primarily composed of 100 Relative Height (RH) metrics, which collectively describe the waveform collected by GEDI.
The original GEDI02_A product is a table of point with a spatial resolution (average footprint) of 25 meters.
Please see [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/986/GEDI02_UserGuide_V2.pdf) for more information.
The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation [GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/) mission aims to characterize ecosystem structure and dynamics to enable radically improved quantification and understanding of the Earth's carbon cycle and biodiversity. The GEDI instrument, attached to the International Space Station (ISS), collects data globally between 51.6° N and 51.6° S latitudes at the highest resolution and densest sampling of the 3-dimensional structure of the Earth. The GEDI instrument consists of three lasers producing a total of eight beam ground transects, which instantaneously sample eight ~25 m footprints spaced approximately every 60 m along-track.
