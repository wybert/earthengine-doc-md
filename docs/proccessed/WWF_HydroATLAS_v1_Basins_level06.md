BasinATLAS is a component of the [HydroATLAS database](https://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydroatlas), which is a component of [HydroSHEDS](https://www.hydrosheds.org).
BasinATLAS provides a standardized compendium of hydro-environmental attribute information for all watersheds of the world at high spatial resolution. This dataset includes data for 56 variables, partitioned into 281 attributes and organized in six categories: hydrology; physiography; climate; land cover & use; soils & geology; and anthropogenic influences (see Table 1 in the HydroATLAS documentation linked below).
Watersheds range from level 1 (coarse) to level 12 (detailed), using Pfastetter codes. The underlying watershed deleniation uses the NASA SRTM Digital Elevatin Map (DEM) below 60oN latitude and the USGS HYDRO1k DEM above 60oN.
Technical documentation:
<https://www.hydrosheds.org/images/inpages/HydroATLAS_TechDoc_v10.pdf>
Note that the quality of HydroATLAS data is significantly lower for regions above 60 degrees northern latitude as there is no underlying SRTM elevation data available and thus a coarser-resolution DEM was used (HYDRO1k provided by USGS).
HydroSHEDS was developed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Conservation Science Program in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, The Nature Conservancy, and the Center for Environmental Systems Research of the University of Kassel, Germany.
**Table Schema**
Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
HYBAS_ID | INT | First 1 digit represents the region: * 1 = Africa * 2 = Europe * 3 = Siberia * 4 = Asia * 5 = Australia * 6 = South America * 7 = North America * 8 = Arctic (North America) * 9 = Greenland. Next 2 digits define the Pfafstetter level (01-12). The value '00' is used for the 'Level 0' layer that contains all original sub-basins and all Pfafstetter codes (at all levels); 'Level 0' only exists in the standard format of HydroBASINS (without lakes). Next 6 digits represent a unique identifier within the HydroSHEDS network; values larger than 900,000 represent lakes and only occur in the customized format (with lakes) Last 1 digit indicates the side of a sub-basin in relation to the river network (0 = noSide; 1 = Left; 2 = Right). Sides are only defined for the customized format (with lakes).  
COAST | INT | Indicator for lumped coastal basins: 0 = no; 1 = yes. Coastal basins represent conglomerates of small coastal watersheds that drain into the ocean between larger river basins.  
DIST_MAIN | DOUBLE | Distance from polygon outlet to the most downstream sink, in km.  
DIST_SINK | DOUBLE | Distance from polygon outlet to the next downstream sink, in km.  
ENDO | INT | Indicator for endorheic (inland) basins without surface flow connection to the ocean: 0 = not part of an endorheic basin; 1 = part of an endorheic basin; 2 = sink (i.e. most downstream polygon) of an endorheic basin.  
MAIN_BAS | INT | Hybas_id of the most downstream sink, i.e. the outlet of the main river basin.  
NEXT_DOWN | INT | Hybas_id of the next downstream polygon.  
NEXT_SINK | INT | Hybas_id of the next downstream sink.  
PFAF_ID | INT | The Pfafstetter code.  
SORT | INT | Indicator showing the record number (sequence) in which the original polygons are stored in the shapefile (i.e. counting upwards from 1 in the original shapefile). The original polygons are sorted from downstream to upstream. This field can be used to sort the polygons back to their original sequence or to perform topological searches.  
SUB_AREA | DOUBLE | Area of basin, in square kilometers.  
UP_AREA | DOUBLE | Total upstream area, in square kilometers.
