Aqueduct Floods data measures riverine and coastal food risks under both current baseline conditions and future projections in 2030, 2050, and 2080. In addition to providing hazard maps and assessing risks, Aqueduct Floods helps to conduct comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the value of dike flood protection strategies.
Aqueduct Floods aims to empower disaster risk analysts and managers with quantitative information on food risks and adaptation strategy costs, and to help inform policy and investment decision-making.
[This](https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/aqueduct-floods-methodology.pdf) technical note explains in detail the framework, methodology, and data used in developing Aqueduct Floods.
