This gap-filled Tasseled Cap Wetness (TCW) dataset was created by applying the tasseled-cap equations defined in Lobser and Cohen (2007) to MODIS BRDF-corrected imagery (MCD43B4). The resulting data were gap-filled using the approach outlined in Weiss et al. (2014) to eliminate missing data caused by factors such as cloud cover, and then the data were aggregated temporally and spatially to produce the monthly ≈5km product.
This dataset was produced by Harry Gibson and Daniel Weiss of the Malaria Atlas Project (Big Data Institute, University of Oxford, United Kingdom, <https://malariaatlas.org/>).
**Pixel Size** 5000 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
`Mean` |  -0.84*  |  0.96*  | The mean value of Tasseled Cap Wetness for each aggregated pixel.  
`FilledProportion` | % |  0*  |  100*  | A quality control band that indicates the percentage of each resulting pixel that was comprised of raw data (as opposed to gap-filled estimates).
