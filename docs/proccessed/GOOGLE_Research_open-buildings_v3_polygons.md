This large-scale open dataset consists of outlines of buildings derived from high-resolution 50 cm satellite imagery. It contains 1.8B building detections in Africa, Latin America, Caribbean, South Asia and Southeast Asia. The inference spanned an area of 58M km².
For each building in this dataset we include the polygon describing its footprint on the ground, a confidence score indicating how sure we are that this is a building, and a [Plus Code](https://plus.codes/) corresponding to the center of the building. There is no information about the type of building, its street address, or any details other than its geometry.
Building footprints are useful for a range of important applications: from population estimation, urban planning and humanitarian response to environmental and climate science. The project is based in Ghana, with an initial focus on the continent of Africa and new updates on South Asia, South-East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.
Inference was carried out during May 2023.
For more details see the official [website](https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/) of the Open Buildings dataset.
**Table Schema**
Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
area_in_meters | DOUBLE | Area in square meters of the polygon.  
confidence | DOUBLE | Confidence score [0.65;1.0] assigned by the model.  
full_plus_code | STRING | The full [Plus Code](https://plus.codes/) at the building polygon centroid.  
longitude_latitude | GEOMETRY | Centroid of the polygon.
