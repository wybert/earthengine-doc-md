IrrMapper is an annual classification of irrigation status in the 11 Western United States made at Landsat scale (i.e., 30 m) using the Random Forest algorithm, covering years 1986 - present.
While the [IrrMapper paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/14/2328) describes classification of four classes (i.e., irrigated, dryland, uncultivated, wetland), the dataset is converted to a binary classification of irrigated and non-irrigated.
'Irrigated' refers to the detection of any irrigation during the year. The IrrMapper random forest model was trained using an extensive geospatial database of land cover from each of four irrigated- and non-irrigated classes, including over 50,000 human-verified irrigated fields, 38,000 dryland fields, and over 500,000 square kilometers of uncultivated lands.
For version 1.2, the original training data was greatly expanded, a RF model built for each state, and a more thorough validation and uncertainty analysis undertaken. See the [supplement](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-023-01152-2/MediaObjects/43247_2023_1152_MOESM3_ESM.docx) to our [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01152-2) on the impacts of irrigation on streamflow.
