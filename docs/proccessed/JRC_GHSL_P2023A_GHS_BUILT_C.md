This spatial raster dataset delineates human settlements at 10 m resolution, and describes their inner characteristics in terms of the functional and height-related components of the built environment.
More information about the GHSL data products can be found in the [GHSL Data Package 2023 report](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/GHSL_Data_Package_2023.pdf?t=1683540422)
The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project is supported by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre, and Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy.
