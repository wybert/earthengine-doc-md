Penman-Monteith-Leuning Evapotranspiration V2 (PML_V2) products include evapotranspiration (ET), its three components, and gross primary production (GPP) at 500m and 8-day resolution during 2000-2023 and with spatial range from -60°S to 90°N. The major advantages of the PML_V2 products are:
  1. Coupled estimates of transpiration and GPP via canopy conductance (Gan et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019)
  2. Partitioning ET into three components: transpiration from vegetation, direct evaporation from the soil, and vaporization of intercepted rainfall from vegetation (Zhang et al., 2016).


The PML_V2 products perform well against observations at 95 flux sites across the globe, and are similar to or noticeably better than major state-of-the-art ET and GPP products widely used by water and ecology research communities (Zhang et al., 2019).
Key changes in v0.1.8 compared with the original v0.1.4:
  1. Temporal coverage is lengthened to the latest (may update annually) with the MODIS C6.1 data.
  2. MODIS Terra LAI (MOD15A2H) is used rather than the composite LAI (MCD15A3H).
  3. Parameters are recalibrated with the change in LAI, while other forcings remain the same.
