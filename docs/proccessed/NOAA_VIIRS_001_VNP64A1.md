The daily Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) NASA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Burned Area (VNP64A1) Version 1 data product is a monthly, global gridded 500m product containing per-pixel burned area and quality information. The VNP64 burned area mapping approach employs 750m VIIRS imagery coupled with 750m VIIRS active fire observations.
VIIRS bands that are both sensitive and insensitive to biomass burning are used to detect changes caused by fire and to differentiate them from other types of change.

**Pixel Size** 500 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Description  
---|---|---  
`Burn_Date` | Ordinal day of burn (1-366) for each 500-m grid cell.  
`Burn_Date_Uncertainty` | % | Estimated uncertainty in date of burn, in days. Unburned, unmapped, and water grid cells are masked out.  
`QA` | Quality Assurance Indicators  
Bitmask for QA
  * Bit 0: land/water state 
    * 0: water grid cell
    * 1: land grid cell
  * Bit 1: Valid data flag (0 = false, 1 = true). A value of 1 indicates that there was sufficient valid data in the reflectance time series for the grid cell to be processed. 
    * 0: false
    * 1: true
  * Bit 2: Shortened mapping period (0 = false, 1 = true). This flag indicates that the period of reliable mapping does not encompass the full one-month product period. 
    * 0: false
    * 1: true
  * Bit 3: Grid cell was relabeled during the contextual relabeling phase of the algorithm (0 = false, 1 = true). 
    * 0: false
    * 1: true
  * Bit 4: Spare bit set to 0 
    * 0: Spare bit
  * Bits 5-7: Special condition code reserved for unburned grid cells. This code provides an explanation for any grid cells that were summarily classified as unburned by the detection algorithm due to special circumstances. 
    * 0: burned, unmapped, or water grid cells
    * 1: Valid observations spaced too sparsely in time
    * 2: Too few training observations or insufficient spectral separability between burned and unburned classes.
    * 3: Apparent burn date at limits of time series
    * 4: Apparent water contamination
    * 5: Persistent hot spot
    * 6: Reserved for future use
    * 7: Reserved for future use

  
`First_Day` | First day of the year of reliable change detection  
`Last_Day` | Last day of the year of reliable change detection
