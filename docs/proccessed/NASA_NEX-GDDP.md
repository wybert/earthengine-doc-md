The NASA NEX-GDDP dataset is comprised of downscaled climate scenarios for the globe that are derived from the General Circulation Model (GCM) runs conducted under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5, see [Taylor et al. 2012](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00094.1)) and across two of the four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, see [Meinshausen et al. 2011](https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-011-0156-z#page-1)). The CMIP5 GCM runs were developed in support of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5).
This dataset was prepared by the Climate Analytics Group and NASA Ames Research Center using the NASA Earth Exchange, and distributed by the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS).
