GEDI Level 2B Canopy Cover and Vertical Profile Metrics product (GEDI02_B) extracts biophysical metrics from each GEDI waveform. These metrics are based on the directional gap probability profile derived from the L1B waveform.
The vertical step between foliage profile measurements (known as dZ in GEDI documentation) is always 5 meters.
The dataset LARSE/GEDI/GEDI02_B_002_MONTHLY is a raster version of the original GEDI02_B product. The raster images are organized as monthly composites of individual orbits in the corresponding month. Only root-level cover, pai and pavd values and their associated quality flags and metadata are preserved as raster bands. Each GEDI02_B_002 raster has 109 bands.
See [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/986/GEDI02_UserGuide_V2.pdf) for more information.
The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation [GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/) mission aims to characterize ecosystem structure and dynamics to enable radically improved quantification and understanding of the Earth's carbon cycle and biodiversity. The GEDI instrument, attached to the International Space Station (ISS), collects data globally between 51.6° N and 51.6° S latitudes at the highest resolution and densest sampling of the 3-dimensional structure of the Earth. The GEDI instrument consists of three lasers producing a total of eight beam ground transects, which instantaneously sample eight ~25 m footprints spaced approximately every 60 m along-track.
