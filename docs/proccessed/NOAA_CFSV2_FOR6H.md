The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System (CFS) is a fully coupled model representing the interaction between the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, land, and sea ice. CFS was developed at the Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) at NCEP. The operational CFS was upgraded to version 2 (CFSv2) on March 30, 2011.
Forecasts are initialized four times per day (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC). This is the same model that was used to create the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and the purpose of the CFSv2 dataset is to extend CFSR. We ingest only a subset of bands from files matching cdas1.t??z.sfluxgrbf**06**.grib2.
For more information about CFS, please see the [CFS NOAA site](https://cfs.ncep.noaa.gov/).
