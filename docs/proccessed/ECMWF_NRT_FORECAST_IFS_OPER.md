This dataset contains 15-day forecasts of the atmospheric model variables generated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) at 0.25 degree resolution. We refer to these as Near-Realtime (NRT) because new products are released twice a day after the release of the ECMWF realtime forecast data, of which this is a subset. Data may be distributed and used commercially with [proper attribution](https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/general/).
Products are available in Earth Engine starting with the implementation of [Cycle 49r1](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FCST/Implementation+of+IFS+Cycle+49r1) on 2024/11/12; earlier products are not included. For general information about how to use ECMWF NRT datasets, see their [user documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/DAC/ECMWF+open+data%3A+real-time+forecasts+from+IFS+and+AIFS). Sources files are available in the [Google Cloud marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/open-data-ecmwf).
