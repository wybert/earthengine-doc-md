The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The GFS dataset consists of selected model outputs (described below) as gridded forecast variables. The 384-hour forecasts, with 1-hour (up to 120 hours) and 3-hour (after 120 hours) forecast intervals, are made at 6-hour temporal resolution (i.e. updated four times daily). Use the 'creation_time' and 'forecast_time' properties to select data of interest.
The GFS is a coupled model, composed of an atmosphere model, an ocean model, a land/soil model, and a sea ice model which work together to provide an accurate picture of weather conditions. Note that this model may change; see [history of recent modifications to the global forecast/analysis system](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/STATS/html/model_changes.html) and the [documentation](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/pages/numerical_forecast_systems/gfs.php) for more information. There may be significant hour-to-hour and day-to-day fluctuations that require noise-reduction techniques to be applied to bands before analysis.
Note that the available forecast hours and intervals have changed over time:
  * From 2015/04/01-2017/07/09: 36-hour forecasts, excluding hour 0, at 3-hour intervals.
  * From 2017/07/09-2021/06/11: 384-hour forecasts, at 1-hour intervals from hours 0-120, at 3-hour intervals from hours 120-240, and 12-hour intervals from hours 240-384.
  * From 2021/06/12: 384-hour forecasts, at 1-hour intervals from hours 0-120 and 3-hour intervals from hours 120-384.


Some bands are only available starting on 2025/01/15 as noted in the band descriptions.

`total_precipitation_surface` | kg/m^2 |  0*  |  626.75*  | Cumulative precipitation at surface for the previous 1-6 hours, depending on the value of the "forecast_hours" property according to the formula ((F - 1) % 6) + 1 (and only for assets with forecast_hours > 0). As a consequence, to calculate the total precipitation by hour X, double-counting should be avoided by only summing the values for forecast_hours that are multiples of 6 plus any remainder to reach X. It also means that to determine the precipitation for just hour X, one must subtract the value for the preceding hour unless X is the first hour in a 6-hour window.
