Daymet V4 provides gridded estimates of daily weather parameters for Continental North America, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico (Data for Puerto Rico is available starting in 1950). It is derived from selected meteorological station data and various supporting data sources.
Compared to the previous version, Daymet V4 provides effective solutions to known issues and further considers improvements to what were believed to be input weather station biases. Improvements include:
  * Reductions in the timing bias of input reporting weather station measurements.
  * Improvement to the three-dimensional regression model techniques in the core algorithm.
  * A novel approach to handling high elevation temperature measurement biases.


2020 and 2021 data are ingested from V4 R1 sources
