The Global Flood Database contains maps of the extent and temporal distribution of 913 flood events occurring between 2000-2018. For more information, see [the associated journal article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03695-w).
Flood events were collected from the [Dartmouth Flood Observatory](https://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/) and used to collect MODIS imagery. The selected 913 events are those that were successfully mapped (passed quality control as having significant inundation beyond permanent water) using 12,719 scenes from Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors. Each pixel was classified as water or non-water at 250-meter resolution during the full date range of each flood event and subsequent data products were generated including maximum flood extent ("flooded" band) and the duration of inundation in days ("duration" band). Water and non-water classifications during a flood event include permanent water (here resampling the 30-meter [JRC Global Surface Water dataset](https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/) representing permanent water to 250-meter resolution), which can be masked out to isolate flood water using the "jrc_perm_water" band. Extra data quality bands were added representing cloud conditions during the flood event (e.g., "clear_views" representing the number of clear days the flood was observed between its start and end dates and "clear_perc" representing the percentage of clear day observation of the total event duration in days).
Each image in the ImageCollection represents the map of an individual flood. The collection can be filtered by date, country, or Dartmouth Flood Observatory original ID.
**Pixel Size** 30 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
`flooded` |  0  |  1  | Maximum extent of flood water during an event.
  * 1 - area of surface water
  * 0 - no water

  
`duration` | d |  0  |  65535  | Duration of surface water during an event in days. Pixel values indicate the number of composite days a pixel's area was considered water during an event. 3-day MODIS composites were used.  
`clear_views` | d |  0  |  65535  | Number of cloud-free observations in days between the start and end day of each event. Cloud coverage is determined by the MODIS Quality Assurance band ('state_1km').  
`clear_perc` | % |  0  |  100  | Percentage of clear view observations during a given flood event. This is equivalent to the 'clear_views' band but normalized to the number of MODIS images per flood event. Cloud coverage is determined by the MODIS Quality Assurance band ('state_1km').  
`jrc_perm_water` |  0  |  1  | Permanent water determined by the JRC Global Surface Water dataset using the 'transition' band. Resolution is maintained as the original 30-meter resolution of the JRC dataset.
  * 1 - permanent water
  * 0 - non-water.
