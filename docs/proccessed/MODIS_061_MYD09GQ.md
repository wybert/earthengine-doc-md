The MODIS Surface Reflectance products provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance as it would be measured at ground level in the absence of atmospheric scattering or absorption. Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols. MYD09GQ version 6.1 provides bands 1 and 2 at a 250m resolution in a daily gridded L2G product in the Sinusoidal projection, including a QC and five observation layers. This product is meant to be used in conjunction with the MYD09GA where important quality and viewing geometry information is stored.
