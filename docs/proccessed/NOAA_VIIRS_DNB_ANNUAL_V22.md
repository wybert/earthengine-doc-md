Annual global VIIRS nighttime lights dataset is a time series produced from monthly cloud-free average radiance grids for 2022. Data for earlier years are available in the [NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/ANNUAL_V21](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NOAA_VIIRS_DNB_ANNUAL_V21) dataset.
An initial filtering step removed sunlit, moonlit and cloudy pixels, leading to rough composites that contains lights, fires, aurora and background. The rough annual composites are made on monthly increments and then combined to form rough annual composites.
The subsequent steps uses the twelve-month median radiance to discard high and low radiance outliers, filtering out most fires and isolating the background. Background areas are zeroed out using the data range (DR) calculated from 3x3 grid cells. The DR threshold for background is indexed to cloud-cover levels, with higher DR thresholds in areas having low numbers of cloud-free coverages.
**Pixel Size** 463.83 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Description  
---|---|---  
`average` | nanoWatts/sr/cm^2 | Average DNB radiance values.  
`average_masked` | nanoWatts/sr/cm^2 | Average Masked DNB radiance values  
`cf_cvg` | Cloud-free coverages; the total number of observations that went into each pixel. This band can be used to identify areas with low numbers of observations where the quality is reduced.  
`cvg` | Total number of observations free of sunlight and moonlight.  
`maximum` | nanoWatts/sr/cm^2 | Maximum DNB radiance values.  
`median` | nanoWatts/sr/cm^2 | Median DNB radiance values  
`median_masked` | nanoWatts/sr/cm^2 | Median masked DNB radiance values.  
`minimum` | nanoWatts/sr/cm^2 | Minimum DNB radiance values
