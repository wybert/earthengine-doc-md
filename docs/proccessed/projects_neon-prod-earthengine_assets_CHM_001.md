Height of the top of canopy above bare earth (Canopy Height Model; CHM). The CHM is derived from the [NEON LiDAR](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/lidar) point cloud and is generated by creating a continuous surface of canopy height estimates across the entire spatial domain of the LiDAR survey. The point cloud is separated into classes representing the ground and vegetation returns. The ground classified points are used to generate a height-normalized point cloud that provides a relative estimate of vegetation elevation. A pit-free surface is then generated using the height normalized vegetation points to produce the CHM. Any canopy heights less than 2 m are set to zero for data collected with the Optech Gemini LiDAR sensors, and less than 0.7 m for the Riegl Q780 and Optech Galaxy sensors. Data are mosaicked over the AOP footprint onto a spatially uniform grid at 1 m spatial resolution. Availability in GEE may not represent full availability in the NEON Data Portal (linked below). Additional sites and years can be added to GEE upon request by emailing listaopgee@battelleecology.org.
