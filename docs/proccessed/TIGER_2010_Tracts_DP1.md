[Description](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/TIGER_2010_Tracts_DP1#description)[Table Schema](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/TIGER_2010_Tracts_DP1#table-schema)[Terms of Use](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/TIGER_2010_Tracts_DP1#terms-of-use)[Citations](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/TIGER_2010_Tracts_DP1#citations) More
The United States Census Bureau regularly releases a geodatabase named TIGER. This table contains the 2010 census Demographic Profile 1 values aggregated by census tract. Tract areas vary tremendously, but in urban areas are roughly equivalent to a neighborhood. There are about 74,000 polygon features covering the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the [Island areas](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2010/dec/2010-island-areas.html).
For full technical details on all TIGER 2010 products, see the [TIGER technical documentation](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2010/TGRSHP10SF1.pdf).
Each tract also includes attributes with sums of the DP1 population measurements that intersect the boundary. The columns have the same name as the shortname column in the [DP1 lookup table](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tiger_2010_tract_dp1_metadata).

aland10 | DOUBLE | Land area  
awater10 | DOUBLE | Water area  
geoid10 | STRING | Census tract identifier: a concatenation of state FIPS code, county FIPS code, and census tract code  
intptlat10 | STRING | Latitude of the internal point  
intptlon10 | STRING | Longitude of the internal point  
namelsad10 | STRING | Legal/statistical area description and the census tract name  
shape_area | DOUBLE | Area in square degrees  
shape_leng | DOUBLE | Perimeter in degrees
