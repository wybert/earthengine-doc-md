**Note: This dataset is not yet peer-reviewed. Please see the GitHub README associated with this model for more information.**
This image provides a per-pixel score (in [0, 1]) that indicates whether the pixel area is occupied by undisturbed forest in year 2020.
These scores are provided at 30 meter resolution, and have been generated by a convergence of evidence approach to combining multiple forest cover data sets into a level of continuous support for the presence of undisturbed forest, defined as naturally regenerating forest with "no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed" or forests "predominantly composed of trees established through natural regeneration." The numerical support, called ForestPersistence, is created from an ensemble of existing datasets selected for their ability to describe forest disturbance and management history, consistent with the definition. 
This community data product is meant to evolve over time, as more data becomes available from the community and the model used to produce the maps continuously improves. To provide map-based feedback on this collection, please see our [Collect Earth Online instance](https://app.collect.earth/collection?projectId=50778) and follow [these instructions](https://collect-earth-online-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collection/simplified.html).
If you would like to provide general feedback or additional datasets to improve these layers, please reach out through [this form](https://goo.gle/fdap-data).
For more information about this dataset, see [the README](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/blob/main/models/forests/README.md) on Google's Forest Data Partnership GitHub site.

**Limitations** : Geographic scope is limited to +/- 80 degrees latitude and to calendar year 2020. Not all geographic regions are equally represented. For example, China, Russia, Australia, New Zealand and other countries lack regionally specific datasets in the ensemble. Boreal forest may not be well represented. This dataset is built from existing datasets, and any limitations and errors associated with those datasets may be present. Landsat TimeLapse is a Google developed product that has not been used with LandTrendr previously. A probability sample of these types of forest cover coincident with the year 2020 is not available, making accuracy difficult to assess.
