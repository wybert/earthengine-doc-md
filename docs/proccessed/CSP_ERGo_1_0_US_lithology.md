The Lithology dataset provides classes of the general types of parent material of soil on the surface. It is not derived from any DEM.
The Conservation Science Partners (CSP) Ecologically Relevant Geomorphology (ERGo) Datasets, Landforms and Physiography contain detailed, multi-scale data on landforms and physiographic (aka land facet) patterns. Although there are many potential uses of these data, the original purpose for these data was to develop an ecologically relevant classification and map of landforms and physiographic classes that are suitable for climate adaptation planning. Because there is large uncertainty associated with future climate conditions and even more uncertainty around ecological responses, providing information about what is unlikely to change offers a strong foundation for managers to build robust climate adaptation plans. The quantification of these features of the landscape is sensitive to the resolution, so we provide the highest resolution possible given the extent and characteristics of a given index.
