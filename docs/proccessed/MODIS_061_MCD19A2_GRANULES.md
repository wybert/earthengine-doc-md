The MCD19A2 V6.1 data product is a MODIS Terra and Aqua combined Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) Land Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) gridded Level 2 product produced daily at 1 km resolution. For more information see the [MAIAC user guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1500/MCD19_User_Guide_V61.pdf).
NOTE: This product has been released with the caveat that the reprocessing for the full mission is expected to continue through summer 2023.
**Pixel Size** 1000 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Scale | Description  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
`Optical_Depth_047` |  -100  |  8000  | 0.001 | Aerosol optical depth over land retrieved in the MODIS Blue band (0.47 μm). AOD is not received at high altitude (greater than 4.2 km) except when smoke or dust is detected; rather, we report a static value of 0.02 used for atmospheric correction.  
`Optical_Depth_055` |  -100  |  8000  | 0.001 | Aerosol optical depth over land retrieved in the MODIS Green band (0.55 μm).  
`AOD_Uncertainty` |  0  |  30000  | 0.0001 | AOD uncertainty based on blue-band surface brightness (reflectance)  
`FineModeFraction` |  0  |  1000  | Fine mode fraction for ocean and large inland lakes  
`Column_WV` | cm |  0  |  30000  | 0.001 | Column water vapor over land, retrieved from MODIS near-IR bands at 0.94 μm. When reported for cloudy pixels, it represents water vapor above the cloud.  
`AOD_QA` | AOD QA  
Bitmask for AOD_QA
  * Bits 0-2: Cloud mask 
    * 0: Undefined
    * 1: Clear
    * 2: Possibly cloudy (detected by AOD filter)
    * 3: Cloudy (detected by cloud mask algorithm)
    * 5: Cloud shadow
    * 6: Hot spot of fire
    * 7: Water sediments
  * Bits 3-4: Land water snow/ice mask 
    * 0: Land
    * 1: Water
    * 2: Snow
    * 3: Ice
  * Bits 5-7: Adjacency mask 
    * 0: Normal condition/Clear
    * 1: Adjacent to clouds
    * 2: Surrounded by more than 4 cloudy pixels
    * 3: Adjacent to a single cloudy pixel
    * 4: Adjacent to snow
    * 5: Snow was previously detected in this pixel
  * Bits 8-11: QA for AOD 
    * 0: Best quality
    * 1: Water Sediments are detected (water)
    * 3: There is 1 neighbor cloud
    * 4: There is >1 neighbor clouds
    * 5: No retrieval (cloudy, or whatever)
    * 6: No retrievals near detected or previously detected snow'
    * 7: Climatology AOD - altitude above 3.5km (water) and 4.2km (land)'
    * 8: No retrieval due to sun glint (water)
    * 9: Retrieved AOD is very low (<0.05) due to glint (water)
    * 10: AOD within +-2km from the coastline is replaced by nearby AOD
    * 11: Land, research quality: AOD retrieved but CM is possibly cloudy
  * Bit 12: Glint mask 
    * 0: No glint
    * 1: Glint (glint angle < 40°)
  * Bits 13-14: Aerosol model 
    * 0: Background model (regional)
    * 1: Smoke model (regional)
    * 2: Dust model
  * Bit 15: Reserved 
    * 0: Reserved for future use
    * 1: Reserved for future use
