This dataset contains maps of the location and temporal distribution of surface water from 1984 to 2021 and provides statistics on the extent and change of those water surfaces. For more information see the associated journal article: [High-resolution mapping of global surface water and its long-term changes](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7633/full/nature20584.html) (Nature, 2016) and the online [Data Users Guide](https://storage.googleapis.com/global-surface-water/downloads_ancillary/DataUsersGuidev2021.pdf).
These data were generated using 4,716,475 scenes from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 acquired between 16 March 1984 and 31 December 2021. Each pixel was individually classified into water / non-water using an expert system and the results were collated into a monthly history for the entire time period and two epochs (1984-1999, 2000-2021) for change detection.
The Monthly Recurrence collection contains 12 images: monthly measures of the seasonality of water based on the occurrence values detected in that month over all years.
**Pixel Size** 30 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
`monthly_recurrence` | % |  0  |  100  | The recurrence value expressed as a percentage for this month.  
`has_observations` | A flag to indicate if the month has observations.  
Bitmask for has_observations
  * Bit 0: Observations for the month. 
    * 0: No valid observations
    * 1: At least 1 valid observation was available
