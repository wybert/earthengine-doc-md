The SWISSIMAGE 10 cm orthophoto mosaic is an assembly of new color digital aerial images over the whole of Switzerland with a ground resolution of 10 cm in the plains and the main alpine valleys and 25 cm in the Alps. It is updated annually.
For more information, please see the [SWISSIMAGE10cm_FR documentation](https://backend.swisstopo.admin.ch/fileservice/sdweb-docs-prod-swisstopoch-files/files/2023/11/14/a84642dc-5feb-48e5-af6b-55df4ae7a10b.pdf)
This RGB collection contains digital aerial images with three bands. Standard deviation for the precision in position: +/- 0.15 m for the ground sample distance of 0.1 m.
