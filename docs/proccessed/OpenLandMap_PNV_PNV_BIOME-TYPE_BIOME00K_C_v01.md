Potential Natural Vegetation biomes global predictions of classes (based on predictions using the BIOMES 6000 dataset's 'current biomes' category.)
Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV) is the vegetation cover in equilibrium with climate that would exist at a given location non-impacted by human activities. PNV is useful for raising public awareness about land degradation and for estimating land potential. This dataset contains results of predictions of - (1) global distribution of biomes based on the BIOME 6000 data set (8057 modern pollen-based site reconstructions), - (2) distribution of forest tree species in Europe based on detailed occurrence records (1,546,435 ground observations), and - (3) global monthly Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) values (30,301 randomly-sampled points).
