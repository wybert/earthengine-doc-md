The Terra and Aqua combined Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) Version 6.1 data product provides global land cover types at yearly intervals. The MCD12Q1 Version 6.1 data product is derived using supervised classifications of MODIS Terra and Aqua reflectance data. Land cover types are derived from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), University of Maryland (UMD), Leaf Area Index (LAI), BIOME-Biogeochemical Cycles (BGC), and Plant Functional Types (PFT) classification schemes. The supervised classifications then underwent additional post-processing that incorporate prior knowledge and ancillary information to further refine specific classes. Additional land cover property assessment layers are provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) for land cover, land use, and surface hydrology.
Layers for Land Cover Type 1-5, Land Cover Property 1-3, Land Cover Property Assessment 1-3, Land Cover Quality Control (QC), and a Land Water Mask are also provided.
