The Iran-wide land cover map was generated by processing Sentinel imagery within the Google Earth Engine Cloud platform. For this purpose, over 2,500 Sentinel-1 and over 11,000 Sentinel-2 images were processed to produce a single mosaic dataset for the year 2017. Then, an object-based Random Forest classification method was trained by a large number of reference samples for 13 classes to generate the Iran-wide land cover map.
