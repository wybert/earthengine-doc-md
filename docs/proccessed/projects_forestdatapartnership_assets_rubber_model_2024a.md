**Note: This dataset is not yet peer-reviewed. Please see the GitHub README associated with this model for more information.**
This image collection provides per-pixel probability that the underlying area is occupied by rubber trees.
The probability estimates are provided at 10 meter resolution, and have been generated by a machine learning model. This dataset corresponds to 2020 and 2023 output from model 2024a in the [Forest Data Partnership repo](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/tree/main/models/rubber) on Github.
The primary purpose of this image collection is to support the mission of the [Forest Data Partnership](https://www.forestdatapartnership.org/) which aims to halt and reverse forest loss from commodity production by collaboratively improving global monitoring, supply chain tracking, and restoration. 
**Note that this dataset has separate terms of use for commercial users of Earth Engine. Please see “Terms of Use” tab for details.**
This community data product is meant to evolve over time, as more data becomes available from the community and the model used to produce the maps continuously improves. To provide map-based feedback on this collection, please see our [Collect Earth Online instance](https://app.collect.earth/collection?projectId=50778) and follow [these instructions](https://collect-earth-online-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collection/simplified.html).
If you would like to provide general feedback or additional datasets to improve these layers, please reach out through [this form](https://goo.gle/fdap-data).
**Limitations** : Model output is limited to selected countries as calendar year composites for 2020 and 2023. Not all regions of the output are represented by training data. Accuracy is reported in aggregate, is based on a notional threshold, and will vary geographically and with user chosen thresholds. Sensor artifacts based on data availability, cross-track nonuniformity, or cloudiness may be visually apparent in output probabilities and result in classification errors at some thresholds. Geographic scope: SE Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Hainan Island), Africa (Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana).
**Pixel Size** 10 meters
