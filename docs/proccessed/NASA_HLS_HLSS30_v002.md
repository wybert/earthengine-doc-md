The Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project provides consistent surface reflectance data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 satellite and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Europe's Copernicus Sentinel-2A satellites. The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2-3 days at 30-meter (m) spatial resolution. The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment.
The HLS project distributes data as two separate products: HLSL30 (Landsat 8/9) and HLSS30 (Sentinel-2 A/B). They both provide 30m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR).
