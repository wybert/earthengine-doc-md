WeatherNext Gen is an experimental dataset of global medium-range ensemble weather forecasts produced by an operational version of Google DeepMind's [diffusion-based ensemble weather model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9).
The experimental dataset includes real-time and historic data. Real-time data is any data that relates to a time that is no more than 48 hours in the past ("Real-Time Experimental Data"), while historic data is any data that relates to a time that is more than 48 hours ago ("Historic Experimental Data"). This dataset includes major surface fields including temperature, wind, precipitation, humidity, geopotential, sea surface temperature, vertical velocity, and pressure. The spatial resolution is 0.25 degrees. Forecast init times have 6 hour resolution (00z, 06z, 12z, 18z). Forecast lead times have 12 hour resolution up to a max lead time of 15 days.
If you are interested in accessing the experimental dataset, please fill out this [WeatherNext Data Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCf1JY8G78UDWzbm0ly9kJxfSjUIJT5WyMR_HiNqCm-IHIBg/viewform).
More information on the model is described in "[GenCast: Diffusion-based ensemble forecasting for medium-range weather](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9)". The model used to produce this experimental dataset is an operational version derived from that research model. Please note that the accuracy of this operational model may not exactly correspond to the accuracy reported for the research model, and that additional variables may be included in this forecast dataset. The forecast dataset generated by the research model and which was used to generate the results in the above paper can be found at `gs://weathernext/weathernext_gen_research_2019`.
If you have any questions on using this experimental dataset, or would like to use it for purposes not currently permitted under the terms of use set out below, please contact weathernext@google.com.
**Accessing Raw Data (.zarr)**
A bucket containing the raw .zarr files for the 2020-present historical dataset ("Historic Experimental Data") is available at `gs://weathernext/126478713_1_0/zarr`. Additionally, 2019 historical forecasts, an extra year of forecasts evaluated in [“Probabilistic weather forecasting with machine learning”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9), are available at `gs://weathernext/weathernext_gen_research_2019`. The 2019 forecast dataset is an additional year of forecast data, complementing the 2020-2024 data available through this dataset listing. The 2019 forecasts are, as in the paper, ERA5 initialized forecasts for a model trained on ERA5. To gain access to those resources, please request access through the same [WeatherNext Data Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCf1JY8G78UDWzbm0ly9kJxfSjUIJT5WyMR_HiNqCm-IHIBg/viewform?usp=preview).
