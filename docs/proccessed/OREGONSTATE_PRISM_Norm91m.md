The PRISM daily and monthly datasets are gridded climate datasets for the conterminous United States, produced by the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University.
Grids are developed using PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model). PRISM interpolation routines simulate how weather and climate vary with elevation, and account for coastal effects, temperature inversions, and terrain barriers that can cause rain shadows. Station data are assimilated from many networks across the country. For more information, see the [Descriptions of PRISM Spatial Climate Datasets](https://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/documents/PRISM_datasets.pdf).
