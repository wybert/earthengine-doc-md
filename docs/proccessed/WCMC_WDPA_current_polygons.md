The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most up-to-date and complete source of information on protected areas, updated monthly with submissions from governments, non-governmental organizations, landowners, and communities. It is managed by the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) with support from IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA).
**WDPA User Manual.** For details including methodologies,standards, data providers, metadata field definitions and descriptions, refer to the [WDPA User Manual](https://pp-import-production.s3.amazonaws.com/WDPA_Manual_1_5.pdf).
The WDPA has two feature classes with associated spatial and tabular data on more than 200k protected areas. About 91% contain polygon boundaries, with the remaining only as points, representing the center of the protected area as much as possible.
**Asset Naming Conventions.** WCMC updates the WDPA on a monthly basis. The most recent version is always available as WCMC/WDPA/current/polygons and WCMC/WDPA/current/points. Historical versions, starting with July 2017, are available in the format WCMC/WDPA/YYYYMM/polygons and WCMC/WDPA/YYYYMM/points.
Please see the [WDPA User Manual](https://pp-import-production.s3.amazonaws.com/WDPA_Manual_1_5.pdf) for additional details on the field list.
**Table Schema**

WDPA_PID | STRING | Unique identifier for parcels or zones within a PA, assigned by UNEP-WCMC.  
PA_DEF | STRING | PA definition. Whether this site meets the IUCN and/or CBD definition of a PA: 1=yes, 0=no (currently stored outside WDPA).

ORIG_NAME | STRING | Name of the PA in the original language.  
DESIG | STRING | Designation of the PA in the native language.  
DESIG_ENG | STRING | Designation of the PA in English. Allowed values for international-level designations: Ramsar Site, Wetland of International Importance; UNESCO-MAB Biosphere Reserve; or World Heritage Site. Allowed values for regional-level designations: Baltic Sea Protected Area (HELCOM), Specially Protected Area (Cartagena Convention), Marine Protected Area (CCAMLR), Marine Protected Area (OSPAR), Site of Community Importance (Habitats Directive), Special Protection Area (Birds Directive), or Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (Barcelona Convention). No fixed values for PAs designated at a national level.  
DESIG_TYPE | STRING | Designation type, one of: national, regional, international, or not applicable  
IUCN_CAT | STRING | IUCN management category, one of: Ia (strict nature reserve), Ib (wilderness area), II (national park), III (natural monument or feature), IV (habitat/species management area), V (protected landscape/seascape), VI (PA with sustainable use of natural resources), not applicable, not assigned, or not reported.  
INT_CRIT | STRING | International criteria, assigned by UNEP-WCMC. For World Heritage and Ramsar sites only.  
MARINE | STRING | This field describes whether a PA falls totally or partially within the marine environment, one of: 0 (100% terrestrial PA), 1 (coastal: marine and terrestrial PA), or 2 (100% marine PA).  
REP_M_AREA | DOUBLE | Marine area in square kilometers provided by the data provider.  
REP_AREA | DOUBLE | The total PA extent, including both marine (if applicable) and terrestrial areas, in square kilometers provided by data provider as specified in the legal text for the site.  
NO_TAKE | STRING | No take means that the taking of living or dead natural resources, inclusive of all methods of fishing, extraction, dumping, dredging and construction, is strictly prohibited in all or part of a marine PA. This is only applicable to PAs where the field marine = 1 or 2. One of: all, part, none, not reported, or not applicable (if MARINE field = 0).  
NO_TK_AREA | DOUBLE | Area of the marine no-take area in square kilometers.

METADATAID | INT | Metadata ID, assigned by UNEP-WCMC. Link to WDPA source table.  
SUB_LOC | STRING | Sub-national location. [ISO 3166-2 sub-national code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) where the PA is located. If the PA is in more than one state, province, region etc., multiple ISO-3166-2 codes can be listed separated by a comma and space.  
PARENT_ISO | STRING | Parent ISO3 code. [ISO 3166-3 character code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-3) of country where the PA is located.  
ISO3 | STRING | ISO3 Code. [ISO 3166-3 character code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-3) of the country or territory where the PA is located.  
GIS_AREA | DOUBLE | Protected area total extent, including both marine (if applicable) and terrestrial areas, in square kilometers calculated by UNEP-WCMC projecting the protected area polygon in the standard Mollweide projection and using GIS software tools.  
GIS_M_AREA | DOUBLE | Protected area marine extent in square kilometers calculated by UNEP-WCMC projecting the protected area polygon in the standard Mollweide projection and using GIS software tools.
