The MOD44W V6 land/water mask 250m product is derived using a decision tree classifier trained with MODIS data and validated with the MOD44W V5 product. A series of masks are applied to address known issues caused by terrain shadow, burn scars, cloudiness, or ice cover in oceans.
**Pixel Size** 250 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Description  
---|---  
`water_mask` | Land-water mask  
Bitmask for water_mask
  * Bit 0: Land-water mask 
    * 0: Land
    * 1: Water

  
`water_mask_QA` | Quality assurance (QA)  
Bitmask for water_mask_QA
  * Bits 0-3: Quality assurance (QA) 
    * 1: High confidence observation
    * 2: Lower confidence water, but MOD44W V5 is water
    * 3: Lower confidence land
    * 4: Ocean mask
    * 5: Ocean mask, but no water detected
    * 6: Burned area (MCD64A1)
    * 7: Urban or impervious surface
    * 8: No water detected, Version 5 MOD44W shows inland water
    * 10: No data (outside of projected area)

  
**Terms of Use**
