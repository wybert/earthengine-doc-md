The Hydrologically Enforced Digital Elevation Model (DEM-H) was derived from the SRTM data acquired by NASA in February 2000. The model has been hydrologically conditioned and drainage enforced. The DEM-H captures flow paths based on SRTM elevations and mapped stream lines, and supports delineation of catchments and related hydrological attributes. The dataset was derived from the 1 second smoothed Digital Elevation Model (DEM-S; ANZCW0703014016) by enforcing hydrological connectivity with the ANUDEM software, using selected AusHydro V1.6 (February 2010) 1:250,000 scale watercourse lines (ANZCW0503900101) and lines derived from DEM-S to define the watercourses. The drainage enforcement has produced a consistent representation of hydrological connectivity with some elevation artifacts resulting from the drainage enforcement. A full description of the methods is in preparation (Dowling et al., in prep).
This product provides a DEM suitable for use in hydrological analysis such as catchment definition and flow routing.
There are several areas with unexpected negative values: close to Canberra around (150.443044, -35.355281) with values of -55 and in Western Australia around (124.84, -16.44) with -43.
