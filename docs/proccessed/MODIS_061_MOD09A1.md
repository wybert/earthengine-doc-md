The MOD09A1 V6.1 product provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of Terra MODIS bands 1-7 at 500m resolution and corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the seven reflectance bands is a quality layer and four observation bands. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite on the basis of high observation coverage, low view angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading.
