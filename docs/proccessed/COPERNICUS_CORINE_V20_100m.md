The CORINE (coordination of information on the environment) Land Cover (CLC) inventory was initiated in 1985 to standardize data collection on land in Europe to support environmental policy development. The project is coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme and implemented by national teams. The number of participating countries has increased over time currently including 33 (EEA) member countries and six cooperating countries (EEA39) with a total area of over 5.8M km2.
CLC2018 is one of the datasets produced within the frame the Corine Land Cover programme referring to land cover / land use status of year 2018. The reference year of the first CLC inventory was 1990 and the first update created in 2000. Later, the update cycle has become 6 years. Satellite imagery provides the geometrical and thematic basis for mapping with in-situ data as essential ancillary information. The basic technical parameters of CLC (i.e. 44 classes in nomenclature, 25 hectares minimum mapping unit (MMU), and 100 meters minimum mapping width) have not changed since the beginning, therefore the results of the different inventories are comparable.
The time period covered by each asset is:
  * 1990 asset: 1989 to 1998
  * 2000 asset: 1999 to 2001
  * 2006 asset: 2005 to 2007
  * 2012 asset: 2011 to 2012
  * 2018 asset: 2017 to 2018
