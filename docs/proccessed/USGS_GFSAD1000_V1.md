The GFSAD is a NASA-funded project to provide high-resolution global cropland data and their water use that contributes towards global food security in the twenty-first century. The GFSAD products are derived through multi-sensor remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat, MODIS, AVHRR), secondary data, and field-plot data and aims at documenting cropland dynamics.
At a nominal 1km scale, V0.1 provides the spatial distribution of a disaggregated five-class global cropland extent map derived from four major studies: Thenkabail et al. (2009a, 2011), Pittman et al. (2010), Yu et al. (2013), and Friedl et al. (2010). V1.0 is a 5-class product that provides information on global cropland extent and irrigated versus rainfed cropping. There is no crop type or crop type dominance information. Cropping intensity (single, double, triple, and continuous crops) can be obtained for every pixel using time-series remote sensing data. The GFSAD1000 nominal 2010 product was created with data from 2007 to 2012.
