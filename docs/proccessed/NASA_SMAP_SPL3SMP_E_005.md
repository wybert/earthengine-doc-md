Data starting from 2023-12-04 are available in the [NASA/SMAP/SPL3SMP_E/006](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_SMAP_SPL3SMP_E_006) collection.
This Level-3 (L3) soil moisture product provides a daily composite of global land surface conditions retrieved by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-Band radiometer. The daily data here were collected from the descending (local solar time of 6 am) and ascending (local solar time of 6 pm) passes.
The SMAP mission is an orbiting observatory that measures the amount of water in the surface soil everywhere on Earth. A detailed description can be found in the [SMAP Handbook](https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/178_SMAP_Handbook_FINAL_1_JULY_2014_Web.pdf). It was launched in January 2015 and started operation in April 2015. The radar instrument, ceasing operation in early 2015 due to failure of radar power supply, collected close to 3 months of science data. The prime mission phase of three years was completed in 2018, and since then SMAP has been in extended operation phase.
SMAP measures soil moisture every 2-3 days. This permits changes around the world to be observed over time scales ranging from major storms to repeated measurements of changes over the seasons.
Everywhere on Earth not covered with water or not frozen, SMAP measures how much water is in the top layer of soil. It also distinguishes between ground that is frozen or thawed. Where the ground is not frozen, SMAP measures the amount of water found between the minerals, rocky material, and organic particles found in soil everywhere in the world (SMAP measures liquid water in the top layer of ground but is not able to measure the ice.)
SPL3SMP_E data are transformed to [geographic coordinates using GDAL libraries](https://github.com/google/earthengine-catalog/blob/main/pipelines/smap_convert_l3.py) before the data are ingested into Google Earth Engine.
See the [SMAP L3 Soil Moisture User Guide](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/spl3smp_e-v005-userguide.pdf) and references therein for additional documentation and algorithm details.
