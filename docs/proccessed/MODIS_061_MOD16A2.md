The MOD16A2 Version 6.1 Evapotranspiration/Latent Heat Flux product is an 8-day composite product produced at 500 meter pixel resolution. The algorithm used for the MOD16 data product collection is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with MODIS remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover.
The pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET & PET) are the sum of all eight days within the composite period. The pixel values for the two Latent Heat layers (LE & PLE) are the average of all eight days within the composite period. Note that the last 8-day period of each year is a 5 or 6-day composite period, depending on the year.
Class assignment in fill values 32761 through 32767 might be inaccurate. They are not included in the EE assets.
According to [the MODIS Science Team](https://forum.earthdata.nasa.gov/viewtopic.php?p=15070#p15070), The MOD16A2 6.1 product will not have data prior to 2021. The MODIS Science team recommends using the gap-filled MOD16A2GF 6.1 product for data from 2000 to 2021 -- and then also 2022 when the data are available. They recommend this as the gap-filled product is expected to be superior in product quality, especially over areas where otherwise the routine product performance would have been negatively impacted by cloudy or poor quality input observations. For the current year, there will not be a gap-filled product until early the following year (i.e. 2023 data should be available in early 2024). So, if a user needs MOD16A2GF 6.1 data for the year 2023 (or the "current" year in the future), they recommend using the MOD16A2 6.1 product, which is generated using the daily observation with climatology observation replacing for the cloudy or poor quality observations.

Bitmask for ET_QC
  * Bit 0: MODLAND_QC bits 
    * 0: Good quality (main algorithm with or without saturation)
    * 1: Other quality (back-up algorithm or fill values)
  * Bit 1: Sensor 
    * 0: Terra
    * 1: Aqua
  * Bit 2: Dead detector 
    * 0: Detectors apparently fine for up to 50% of channels 1, 2
    * 1: Dead detectors caused >50% adjacent detector retrieval
  * Bits 3-4: Cloud state 
    * 0: Significant clouds NOT present (clear)
    * 1: Significant clouds WERE present
    * 2: Mixed cloud present on pixel
    * 3: Cloud state not defined, assumed clear
  * Bits 5-7: SCF_QC 5-level confidence quality score 
    * 0: Main (RT) method used, best result possible (no saturation)
    * 1: Main (RT) method used with saturation. Good, very usable
    * 2: Main (RT) method failed due to bad geometry, empirical algorithm used
    * 3: Main (RT) method failed due to problems other than geometry, empirical algorithm used
    * 4: Pixel not produced at all, value couldn't be retrieved (possible reasons: bad L1B data, unusable MOD09GA data)
