The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) was designed and executed as a global, high-resolution, coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface-sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over the 32-year period of record from January 1979 to March 2011. It has been extended as an operational real-time product. The data in Earth Engine are only present starting from December 13, 2018.
Forecasts are initialized four times per day (0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC). We ingest only a subset of bands from files matching `cdas1.t??z.pgrbh**03|00**.grib2`, i.e. files of only 0-hour and 3-hour forecasts as the others are omitted. The forecast length is indicated by the 'forecast_hour' metadata field.
Some images contain only a subset of bands. Using this dataset with both "00" and "03" forecast types will require you to cast the bands across the collection.
