The global 25m PALSAR/PALSAR-2 mosaic is a seamless global SAR image created by mosaicking strips of SAR imagery from PALSAR/PALSAR-2. For each year and location, the strip data were selected through visual inspection of the browse mosaics available over the period, with those showing minimum response to surface moisture preferentially used. Only data from the target year have been used for each annual mosaic, and hence no gap-filling using data from previous years in case of gaps in the annual global coverage.
There is no data for 2011-2014 due to the gap between ALOS and ALOS-2 temporal coverage.
The SAR imagery was ortho-rectificatied and slope corrected using the digital surface model ALOS World 3D - 30m (AW3D30).
A destriping process (Shimada & Isoguchi, 2002, 2010) was applied to equalize the intensity differences between neighboring strips, occurring largely due to seasonal and daily differences in surface moisture conditions.
Polarization data are stored as 16-bit digital numbers (DN). The DN values can be converted to gamma naught values in decibel unit (dB) using the following equation:
  * γ₀ = 10log₁₀(DN²) - 83.0 dB


Attention:
  * Backscatter values may vary significantly from path to path over high latitude forest areas. This is due to the change of backscattering intensity caused by freezing trees in winter.

**Pixel Size** 25 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Description  
---|---|---  
`HH` | HH polarization backscattering coefficient, 16-bit DN.  
`HV` | HV polarization backscattering coefficient, 16-bit DN.  
`angle` | deg | Local incidence angle.  
`epoch` | Observation date timestamp (milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970). This band is computed on the fly from the 'date' band of the raw data, which represents the difference in days between 2014-05-24 and the observation date.  
`qa` | Processing information.  
**qa Class Table**
Value | Color | Description  
---|---|---  
0 | #000000 | No data  
50 | #0000ff | Ocean and water  
100 | #aaaa00 | Radar layover  
150 | #005555 | Radar shadowing
