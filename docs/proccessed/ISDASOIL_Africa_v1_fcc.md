Soil fertility capability classification derived using slope, chemical, and physical soil properties. For more information about this layer, please visit [this page](https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil/faq/#faq7).
The classes for the 'fcc' band apply to pixel values that must be back-transformed with `x modulo 3000`.
In areas of dense jungle (generally over central Africa), model accuracy is low and therefore artifacts such as banding (striping) might be seen.
Soil property predictions were made by [Innovative Solutions for Decision Agriculture Ltd. (iSDA)](https://isda-africa.com/) at 30 m pixel size using machine learning coupled with remote sensing data and a training set of over 100,000 analyzed soil samples.
Further information can be found in the [FAQ](https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil/faq/) and [technical information documentation](https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil/technical-information/). To submit an issue or request support, please visit [the iSDAsoil site](https://isda-africa.com/isdasoil).
