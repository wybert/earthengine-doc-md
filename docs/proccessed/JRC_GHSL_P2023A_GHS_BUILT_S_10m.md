This raster dataset depicts the distribution of built-up surfaces, expressed in square metres per 10 m grid cell, for 2018 as observed from the S2 image data.
The datasets measure: a) the total built-up surface, and b) the built-up surface allocated to grid cells of predominant non-residential (NRES) use.
