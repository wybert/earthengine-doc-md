NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS-2) has three components: GLDAS-2.0, GLDAS-2.1, and GLDAS-2.2. GLDAS-2.0 is forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing input data and provides a temporally consistent series from 1948 through 2014. GLDAS-2.1 is forced with a combination of model and observation data from 2000 to present. GLDAS-2.2 product suites use data assimilation (DA), whereas the GLDAS-2.0 and GLDAS-2.1 products are "open-loop" (i.e., no data assimilation). The choice of forcing data, as well as DA observation source, variable, and scheme, vary for different GLDAS-2.2 products.GLDAS-2.0 is one of two components of the GLDAS Version 2 (GLDAS-2) dataset, the second being GLDAS-2.1. GLDAS-2.0 is reprocessed with the updated Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset (Sheffield et al., 2006) and upgraded Land Information System Version 7 (LIS-7). It covers the period 1948-2010, and will be extended to more recent years as corresponding forcing data become available.
The model simulation was initialized on January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulation used the common GLDAS datasets for land cover (MCD12Q1: Friedl et al., 2010), land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture (Reynolds, 1999), and elevation (GTOPO30). The MODIS based land surface parameters are used in the current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012).
