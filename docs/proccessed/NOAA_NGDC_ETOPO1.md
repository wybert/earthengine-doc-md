ETOPO1 is a 1 arc-minute global relief model of Earth''s surface that integrates land topography and ocean bathymetry. It was built from numerous global and regional data sets. It contains two elevation bands: ice_surface and bedrock.
**Pixel Size** 1855 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
`bedrock` | m |  -10898*  |  8271*  | Elevation at ground level and at the base of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets  
`ice_surface` | m |  -10898*  |  8271*  | Elevation at ground level and at the top of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets  
* estimated min or max value
