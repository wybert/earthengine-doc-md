Monthly precipitation in mm at 1 km resolution based on [SM2RAIN-ASCAT 2007-2018](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2615278), IMERG, CHELSA Climate, and WorldClim.
[Downscaled to 1 km resolution using gdalwarp](https://gitlab.com/openlandmap/global-layers/tree/master/input_layers/clim1km) (cubic splines) and an average between [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html), [CHELSA Climate](https://chelsa-climate.org/), and [IMERG monthly product](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) (see, e.g, "3B-MO-L.GIS.IMERG.20180601.V05B.tif"). 3x higher weight is given to the SM2RAIN-ASCAT data since it assumed to be more accurate. Processing steps are available [here](https://gitlab.com/openlandmap/global-layers/tree/master/input_layers/clim1km). Antarctica is not included.
