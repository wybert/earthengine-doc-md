MERIT Hydro is a new global flow direction map at 3 arc-second resolution (~90 m at the equator) derived from the version 1.0.3 of the MERIT DEM elevation data and water body datasets (G1WBM, GSWO and OpenStreetMap).
MERIT Hydro contains the output of a new algorithm that extracts river networks near-automatically by separating actual inland basins from noise caused by the errors in input elevation data. After a minimum amount of hand-editing, the constructed hydrography map shows good agreement with existing quality-controlled river network datasets in terms of flow accumulation area and river basin shape (see Figure 9a in the paper). The location of river streamlines was realistically aligned with existing satellite-based global river channel data (see Figure 10a in the paper). Relative error in the drainage area was smaller than 0.05 for 90% of GRDC gauges, confirming the accuracy of the delineated global river networks. Discrepancies in flow accumulation area were found mostly in arid river basins containing depressions that are occasionally connected at high water levels and thus resulting in uncertain watershed boundaries.
MERIT Hydro improves on existing global hydrography datasets in terms of spatial coverage (between 90N and 60S) and representation of small streams, mainly due to increased availability of high-quality baseline geospatial datasets.

Known Problems:
  * River width (Update from GWD-LR v1): Width algorithm was updated to consider sub-pixel water fraction. Now, 30 m water map is used for width calculation at 90 m resolution. Currently river width is calculated for each channel separately in braided/anabranching sections. Merged river width should be calculated.
  * Water body map: There are some inconsistencies between the DEM land sea mask and wate body data (such as new islands along the coast). The quality of OpenStreeetMap water body layer is not uniform in all areas.
  * Channel bifurcations: Channel bifurcation is not well represented in the current version. Each pixel is assumed to have only one downstream direction. Secondary (or multiple) downstream direction should be considered, to represent complex river networks in the delta regions, floodplains, and braided rivers.
  * Underground rivers/tunnels: Major underground rivers/tunnels should be implemented to improve large-scale water balance.
  * River/lake separation: Rivers and lakes need to be separated better for some applications.
  * Below-sea-level areas: The areas below sea level in coastal regions are not well represented in adjusted elevation data.
  * Flow direction over glaciers: Flow direction over glaciers is not well represented, because the elevation of glacier centerline is higher than glacier edge.
  * Supplementary data: It would be better to add location of GRDC gauging stations, water falls, reservoirs, etc.

`wth` | River channel width at the channel centerlines. River channel width is calculated by the method described in [Yamazaki et al. 2012, WRR], with some improvements/changes on the algorithm.  
`wat` | Land and permanent water
  * 0: Land

`upa` | km^2 | Upstream drainage area (flow accumulation area)  
`upg` | Number of upstream pixels | Upstream drainage pixel (flow accumulation grid).  
`hnd` | m | Hydrologically adjusted elevations, also know as "hand" (height above the nearest drainage). The elevations are adjusted to satisfy the condition "downstream is not higher than its upstream" while minimizing the required modifications from the original DEM. The elevation above EGM96 geoid is represented in meters, and the vertical increment is set to 10cm. For detailed method, see [Yamazaki et al., 2012, WRR].  
`viswth` | Visualization of the river channel width.
