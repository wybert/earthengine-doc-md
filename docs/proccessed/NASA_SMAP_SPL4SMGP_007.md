The SMAP Level-4 (L4) Soil Moisture product includes surface soil moisture (0-5 cm vertical average), root-zone soil moisture (0-100 cm vertical average), and additional research products (not validated), including surface meteorological forcing variables, soil temperature, evapotranspiration, and net radiation.
SMAP L4 provides uninterrupted soil moisture data. During outages of the SMAP instrument, SMAP L4 soil moisture is based on land model simulations alone, without the concomitant assimilation of SMAP brightness temperature observations. Significant SMAP instrument outages occurred between 19 June and 23 July 2019 and between 6 August and 20 September 2022.
SMAP L-band brightness temperature data from descending and ascending half-orbit satellite passes (approximately 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. local solar time, respectively) are assimilated into a land surface model that is gridded using an Earth-fixed, global cylindrical 9 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid, Version 2.0 (EASE-Grid 2.0) projection.
The SPL4SMGP product includes a series of 3-hourly time-averaged geophysical data fields from the assimilation system. SPL4SMGP data are transformed to [geographic coordinates using GDAL libraries](https://github.com/google/earthengine-catalog/blob/main/pipelines/smap_convert_l4.py) before the data are ingested into Google Earth Engine.
See the [SMAP L4 Soil Moisture User Guide](https://nsidc.org/sites/default/files/documents/user-guide/multi_spl4smau-v007-userguide.pdf) and references therein for additional documentation and algorithm details.
