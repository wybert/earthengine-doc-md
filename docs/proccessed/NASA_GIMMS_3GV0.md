#### Description
GIMMS NDVI is generated from several NOAA's AVHRR sensors for a global 1/12-degree lat/lon grid. The latest version of the GIMMS NDVI dataset is named NDVI3g (third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors).
### Bands
**Pixel Size** 9277 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Min | Max | Description  
---|---|---|---  
`ndvi` |  -1  |  1  | NDVI  
`qa` | QA flag  
Bitmask for qa
  * Bits 0-2: QA flag values 
    * 1: Good value
    * 2: Good value
    * 3: NDVI retrieved from spline interpolation
    * 4: NDVI retrieved from spline interpolation, possibly snow
    * 5: NDVI retrieved from average seasonal profile
    * 6: NDVI retrieved from average seasonal profile, possibly snow
    * 7: Missing data
