Digital models of the surface (DSM) and terrain (DTM) derived from [NEON LiDAR data](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/lidar). DSM: Surface features (topographic information with vegetation and man-made structures present). DTM: Bare earth elevation (topographic information with vegetation and man-made structures removed). Images are given in meters above mean sea level and mosaicked onto a spatially uniform grid at 1 m resolution. Availability in GEE may not represent full availability in the NEON Data Portal (linked below). Additional sites and years can be added to GEE upon request by emailing listaopgee@battelleecology.org.
See [NEON Data Product DP3.30024.001](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30024.001) for more details.
