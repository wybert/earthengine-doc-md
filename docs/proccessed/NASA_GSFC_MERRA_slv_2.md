M2T1NXSLV (or tavg1_2d_slv_Nx) is an hourly time-averaged 2-dimensional data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of meteorology diagnostics at popularly used vertical levels, such as air temperature at 2-meter (or at 10-meter, 850hPa, 500 hPa, 250hPa), wind components at 50-meter (or at 2-meter, 10-meter, 850 hPa, 500hPa, 250 hPa), sea level pressure, surface pressure, and total precipitable water vapor (or ice water, liquid water). The data field is time-stamped with the central time of an hour starting from 00:30 UTC, e.g.: 00:30, 01:30, ... , 23:30 UTC.
MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4. The dataset covers the period of 1980-present with the latency of ~3 weeks after the end of a month.
