Global high-resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are a prerequisite for the accurate measurement of the impacts of population growth, for monitoring changes, and for planning interventions. The WorldPop project aims to meet these needs through the provision of detailed and open access population distribution datasets built using transparent and peer-reviewed approaches.
Full details on the methods and datasets used in constructing the data, along with open access publications, are provided on the [WorldPop website](https://www.worldpop.org/). In brief, recent census-based population counts matched to their associated administrative units are disaggregated to ~100x100m grid cells through machine learning approaches that exploit the relationships between population densities and a range of geospatial covariate layers. The mapping approach is Random Forest-based dasymetric redistribution.
This dataset depict estimated number of people residing in each grid cell in 2010, 2015, and other years.
For 2020, the breakdown of population by age and sex is available in the [WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WorldPop_GP_100m_pop_age_sex) and [WorldPop/GP/100m/pop_age_sex_cons_unadj](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WorldPop_GP_100m_pop_age_sex_cons_unadj) collections.
Further WorldPop gridded datasets on population age structures, poverty, urban growth, and population dynamics are freely available on the WorldPop website. WorldPop represents a collaboration between researchers at the University of Southampton, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, and University of Louisville. The project is principally funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
