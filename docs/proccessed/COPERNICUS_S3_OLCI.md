The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) Earth Observation Full Resolution (EFR) dataset contains top of atmosphere radiances at 21 spectral bands with center wavelengths ranging between 0.4µm and 1.02µm at spatial resolution of 300m with worldwide coverage every ~2 days.
OLCI is one of the instruments in the ESA/EUMETSAT Sentinel-3 mission for measuring sea-surface topography, sea- and land-surface temperature, ocean color and land color with high-end accuracy and reliability to support ocean forecasting systems, as well as environmental and climate monitoring.
The Sentinel-3 OLCI instrument is based on the optomechanical and imaging design of ENVISAT's MERIS. It is designed to retrieve the spectral distribution of upwelling radiance just above the sea surface (the water-leaving radiance).
OLCI observation is performed simultaneously in 21 spectral bands ranging from the visible to the near-infrared (400 to 1029 nm).
