The FLDAS dataset (McNally et al. 2017), was designed to assist with food security assessments in data-sparse, developing country settings. It includes information on many climate-related variables including moisture content, humidity, evapotranspiration, average soil temperature, total precipitation rate, etc.
There are multiple different FLDAS datasets; this one uses Noah version 3.6.1 surface model with CHIRPS-6 hourly rainfall that has been downscaled using the [NASA Land Surface Data Toolkit](https://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/ldt). which is part of the [Land Information System framework](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LIS;%20%5Bhttps:/lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/%5D\(https:/lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/\)). Temporal desegregation is required so that daily rainfall inputs can be used in both energy and water balance calculations
For forcing data, this simulation uses a combination of the new version of Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), a quasi-global rainfall dataset designed for seasonal drought monitoring and trend analysis (Funk et al., 2015).
