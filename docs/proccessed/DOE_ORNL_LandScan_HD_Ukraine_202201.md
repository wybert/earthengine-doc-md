[LandScan High Definition (HD)](https://landscan.ornl.gov) provides gridded population estimates at 3 arc-second (~100m) resolution. Values for each LandScan HD cell represent an ambient (i.e. 24 hour average) population count estimate. In this way, the data capture the full potential activity space of people throughout the course of the day and night rather than just a residential location. The LandScan HD model incorporates current land use and infrastructure data from a variety of sources, applies facility occupancy estimates from ORNL's Population Density Tables (PDT) project, and leverages novel image processing algorithms developed at ORNL to rapidly map building structures and neighborhood areas using high-performance computing environments.
The source for subnational population counts used in the development of this data comes from [State Statistics Service of Ukraine](https://ukrstat.org/en/operativ/operativ2021/ds/kn/arh_kn2021_e.html).
These subnational estimates were adjusted to the country total population provided by the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ukraine/#people-and-society).
