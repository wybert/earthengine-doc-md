The OpenET dataset includes satellite-based data on the total amount of water that is transferred from the land surface to the atmosphere through the process of evapotranspiration (ET). OpenET provides ET data from multiple satellite-driven models, and also calculates a single "ensemble value" from the model ensemble. The models currently included in the OpenET model ensemble are ALEXI/DisALEXI, eeMETRIC, geeSEBAL, PT-JPL, SIMS, and SSEBop. The OpenET ensemble ET value is calculated as the mean of the ensemble after filtering and removing outliers using the median absolute deviation approach. All models currently use Landsat satellite data to produce ET data at a pixel size of 30 meters by 30 meters (0.22 acres per pixel). The monthly ET dataset provides data on total ET by month as an equivalent depth of water in millimeters.
