**NOTE from WRI** : WRI decided to stop updating FORMA alerts. The goal was to simplify the [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org) user experience and reduce redundancy. We found that [Terra-i](http://www.terra-i.org/terra-i.html) and [GLAD](https://glad-forest-alert.appspot.com/) were more frequently used. Moreover, using GLAD as a standard, found that Terra-i outperformed FORMA globally.
FORMA alerts are detected using a combination of two MODIS products: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and FIRMS (Fires Information for Resource Management System). NDVI updates are processed every 16 days, while fire updates are processed daily. Models are developed individually for each ecogroup to relate the two inputs to the area of clearing, using the Hansen annual tree cover loss data to train the model. The minimum threshold to qualify as an alert is 25% of the pixel cleared, though thresholds vary by ecogroup to minimize false positives. Here is an [example script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/f29b1e4360f3fc36847bd789ceeb20f6) for a quick introduction to the FORMA datasets.
This image contains the thresholds at which, when crossed, a FORMA alert is produced. The values are equal to max(25,40%*RegionalMax), where RegionalMax is the historical maximum clearing for a pixel in this ecogroup.
**Pixel Size** 250 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
`delta_bound` | % |  25  |  40  | The thresholds at which, when crossed, a FORMA alert is produced  
**Terms of Use**
The FORMA datasets are available without restriction on use or distribution. WRI does request that the user give proper attribution and identify WRI and GFW, where applicable, as the source of the data.
