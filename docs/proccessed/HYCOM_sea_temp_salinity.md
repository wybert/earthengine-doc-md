The Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) is a data-assimilative hybrid isopycnal-sigma-pressure (generalized) coordinate ocean model. The subset of HYCOM data hosted in EE contains the variables salinity, temperature, velocity, and elevation. They have been interpolated to a uniform 0.08 degree lat/long grid between 80.48°S and 80.48°N. The salinity, temperature, and velocity variables have been interpolated to 40 standard z-levels.
The HYCOM Consortium, which includes the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP), is part of the U.S. Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE).
Funded by the National Ocean Partnership Program, the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program.
