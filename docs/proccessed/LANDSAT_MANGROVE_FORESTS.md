The database was prepared using Landsat satellite data from the year 2000. More than 1,000 Landsat scenes obtained from the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (EROS) were classified using hybrid supervised and unsupervised digital image classification techniques. This database is the first, most comprehensive mangrove assessment of the world ([Giri et al., 2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00584.x)). Partial funding of this research was provided by NASA.
The mangrove database is being used for identifying priority areas for mangrove conservation, studying the role of mangrove forests in saving lives and properties from natural disasters (e.g. tsunami), carbon accounting, and biodiversity conservation. The USGS EROS has been using the data to study the impact of sea level rise on mangrove ecosystems. The database serves as a baseline for mangrove monitoring.
