The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a crop-specific land cover data layer created annually for the continental United States using moderate resolution satellite imagery and extensive agricultural ground truth. The CDL is created by the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Research and Development Division, Geospatial Information Branch, Spatial Analysis Research Section.
For detailed FAQ please visit [CropScape and Cropland Data Layers - FAQs](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/sarsfaqs2.php).
To explore details about the classification accuracies and utility of the data, see [state-level omission and commission errors by crop type and year](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/metadata/meta.php).
The asset date is aligned with the calendar year of harvest. For most crops the planted and harvest year are the same. Some exceptions: winter wheat is unique, as it is planted in the prior year. A hay crop like alfalfa could have been planted years prior.
For winter wheat the data also have a class called "Double Crop Winter Wheat/Soybeans". Some mid-latitude areas of the US have conditions such that a second crop (usually soybeans) can be planted immediately after the harvest of winter wheat and itself still be harvested within the same year. So for mapping winter wheat areas use both classes (use both values 24 and 26).
While the CDL date is aligned with year of harvest, the map itself is more representative of what was planted. In other words, a small percentage of fields on a given year will not be harvested.
Some non-agricultural categories are duplicate due to [two very different epochs in methodology](https://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nass.usda.gov%2FResearch_and_Science%2FCropland%2F).
The non-ag codes 63-65 and 81-88 are holdovers from the older methodology and will only appear in CDLs from 2007 and earlier. The non-ag codes from 111-195 are from the current methodology which uses the USGS NLCD as non-ag training and will only appear in CDLs 2007 and newer.
2007 was a transition year so there may be both sets of categories in the 2007 national product but will not appear within the same state.
**Note:** The 2024 CDL only has the data band. The cultivated and confidence bands are yet to be released by the provider.

Name | Min | Max | Description  
---|---|---|---  
`cropland` |  1  |  254  | Main crop-specific land cover classification.
