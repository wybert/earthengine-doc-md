LANDFIRE (LF), Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools, is a shared program between the wildland fire management programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service, U.S. Department of the Interior's Geological Survey, and The Nature Conservancy.
Landfire (LF) Historical fire regimes, intervals, and vegetation conditions are mapped using the Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (VDDT). These data support fire and landscape management planning goals in the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy, the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy, and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act.
Vegetation Departure (VDep) indicates how different current vegetation on a landscape is from estimated historical conditions. VDep is based on changes to species composition, structural stage, and canopy closure using methods originally described in the Interagency Fire Regime Condition Class Guidebook, but is not identical to those methods. LANDFIRE (LF) VDep is based only on departure of current vegetation conditions from reference vegetation conditions, whereas the Guidebook approach includes departure of current fire regimes from those of the reference period. VDep is a landscape metric and is scale dependent. Every pixel in a unique biophysical settings (BpS) in a summary unit has the same VDep value. These large landscape values may not represent smaller areas within a summary unit. The VDep metric ranges from 0 - 100, and is based on four factors. These inputs are held constant within a single version of LF, but can be different across LF versions, which directly impacts VDep comparability across versions. VDep can be compared across versions but caution is advised.
The LANDIFRE Fire datasets include:
  * Fire Regime Groups (FRG) is intended to characterize presumed historical fire regimes within landscapes based on interactions between vegetation dynamics, fire spread, fire effects, and spatial context
  * Mean Fire Return Interval (MFRI) quantifies the average period between fires under the presumed historical fire regime
  * Percent of Low-severity Fire (PLS) image quantifies the amount of low-severity fires relative to mixed- and replacement-severity fires under the presumed historical fire regime and is defined as less than 25 percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given vegetation type
  * Percent of Mixed-severity Fire (PMS) layer quantifies the amount of mixed-severity fires relative to low- and replacement-severity fires under the presumed historical fire regime, and is defined as between 25 and 75 percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given vegetation type
  * Percent of Replacement-severity Fire (PRS) layer quantifies the amount of replacement-severity fires relative to low- and mixed-severity fires under the presumed historical fire regime, and is defined as greater than 75 percent average top-kill within a typical fire perimeter for a given vegetation type
  * Succession Classes (SClass) layer characterizes current vegetation conditions with respect to the vegetation species composition, cover, and height ranges of successional states that occur within each biophysical setting
  * Vegetation Condition Class (VCC) represents a simple categorization of the associated Vegetation Departure (VDEP) layer and indicates the general level to which current vegetation is different from the simulated historical vegetation reference conditions
  * Vegetation Departure (VDep) indicates how different current vegetation on a landscape is from estimated historical conditions. VDep is based on changes to species composition, structural stage, and canopy closure.
