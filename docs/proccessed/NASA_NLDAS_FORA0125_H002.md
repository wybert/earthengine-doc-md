Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) combines multiple sources of observations (such as precipitation gauge data, satellite data, and radar precipitation measurements) to produce estimates of climatological properties at or near the Earth''s surface.
This dataset is the primary (default) forcing file (File A) for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th-degree grid spacing; the temporal resolution is hourly.
NLDAS is a collaboration project among several groups: NOAA/NCEP''s Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), NASA''s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Princeton University, the University of Washington, the NOAA/NWS Office of Hydrological Development (OHD), and the NOAA/NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC). NLDAS is a core project with support from NOAA''s Climate Prediction Program for the Americas (CPPA).
