This dataset is a digital elevation model (DEM) of the Antarctic ice sheet and ice shelves based on observations recorded by the CryoSat-2 satellite radar altimeter between July 2010 and July 2016.
The DEM is formed from spatio-temporal fits to elevation measurements accumulated within 1, 2, and 5 km grid cells, and is posted at the modal resolution of 1 km. The median and root mean square difference between the DEM and 2.3*107; airborne laser altimeter measurements acquired during NASA Operation IceBridge campaigns are -0.30 and 13.50 m, respectively.
The DEM uncertainty rises in regions of high slope, especially where elevation measurements were acquired in low-resolution mode; taking this into account, we estimate the average accuracy to be 9.5 m.
**Pixel Size** 1000 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Description  
---|---|---  
`elevation` | m | Antarctic ice sheet and ice shelf elevation.  
`data_composition` | Data processing method of elevation per grid cell.  
`slope` | deg | Slope derived from elevation gradient.  
`z_smoothed` | m | Smoothed version of elevation model using a median filter.  
`z_uncertainty` | m | Certainty of elevation model derived from RMS of elevation residuals in observed grid cells and the kriging variance error in interpolated grid cells.
