The MCD43A2 V6.1 Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) Quality dataset is a 500 meter daily 16-day product. It contains all the quality information for the corresponding 16-day MCD43A3 Albedo and the MCD43A4 Nadir-BRDF (NBAR) products.
The MCD43A2 contains individual band quality and observation information for the MODIS land bands 1-7, along with the overall BRDF/Albedo quality information.
See [dataset user guide](https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/terra_aqua_modis/v006/mcd43a2_albedo_product) for more information.
