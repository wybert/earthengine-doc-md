The [Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/lucas) in the European Union (EU) was set up to provide statistical information. It represents a triennial in-situ landcover and land-use data-collection exercise that extends over the whole of the EU's territory. LUCAS collects information on land cover and land use, agro-environmental variables, soil, and grassland. The surveys also provide spatial information to analyse the mutual influences between agriculture, environment, and countryside, such as irrigation and land management.
The dataset presented here is the harmonized version of all yearly LUCAS surveys with a total of 106 attributes. Each point's location is using the fields 'th_lat' and 'th_lon', that is, the LUCAS theoretical location (THLOC), as prescribed by the LUCAS grid. For more information please see Citations. Note that not every field is present for every year - see the "Years" section in property descriptions.
The text "C1 (Instructions)" in the table schema descriptions refers to [this document](https://jeodpp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ftp/jrc-opendata/LUCAS/LUCAS_harmonised/3_supporting/LUCAS2018-C1-Instructions.pdf).
