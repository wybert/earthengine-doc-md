The RCMAP (Rangeland Condition Monitoring Assessment and Projection) dataset quantifies the percent cover of rangeland components across western North America using Landsat imagery from 1985-2023. The RCMAP product suite consists of ten fractional components: annual herbaceous, bare ground, herbaceous, litter, non-sagebrush shrub, perennial herbaceous, sagebrush, shrub, tree, and shrub height in addition to the temporal trends of each component. Several enhancements were made to the RCMAP process relative to prior generations. First, high-resolution training was revised using an improved neural-net classifier and modelling approach. These data serve as foundation to the RCMAP approach. The training database was further improved by incorporating additional datasets. Next, the Landsat compositing approach was improved to better capture the range of conditions from across each year and through time. These composites are based on Collection 2 Landsat data with improved geolocation accuracy and dynamic range. Finally, the Canadian portion of the sagebrush biome was included, which expanded the study area by 29,199 km2.
Processing efficiency has been increased using open-source software and USGS High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources. The mapping area included eight regions which were subsequently mosaicked. These data can be used to answer critical questions regarding the influence of climate change and the suitability of management practices. Component products can be downloaded at [Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium](https://www.mrlc.gov/data).
The temporal patterns were assessed in each RCMAP component with two approaches, 1) linear trends and 2) a breaks and stable states method with an 8-year temporal moving window based on structural change at the pixel level. Linear trend products include slope and p-value calculated from least squares linear regression. The slope represents the average percent cover change per year over the times-series and the p-value reflects the confidence of change in each pixel. The structural change method partitions the time-series into segments of similar slope values, with statistically significant breakpoints indicating perturbations to the prior trajectory. The break point trends analysis suite relies on structural break methods, resulting in the identification of the number and timing of breaks in the time-series, and the significance of each segment. The following statistics were produced: 1) for each component, each year, the presence/absence of breaks, 2) the slope, p-value, and standard error of the segment occurring in each year, 3) the overall model R2 (quality of model fit to the temporal profile), and 4) an index, Total Change Intensity. This index reflects the total amount of change occurring across components in that pixel. The linear and structural change methods generally agreed on patterns of change, but the latter found breaks more often, with at least one break point in most pixels. The structural change model provides more robust statistics on the significant minority of pixels with non-monotonic trends, while detrending some interannual signal potentially superfluous from a long-term perspective.
