The NASA NEX-DCP30 dataset is comprised of downscaled climate scenarios for the conterminous United States that are derived from the General Circulation Model (GCM) runs conducted under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5, see [Taylor et al. 2012](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00094.1)) and across the four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, see [Meinshausen et al. 2011](https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-011-0156-z#page-1)) developed for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). The purpose of these datasets is to provide a set of high resolution, bias-corrected climate change projections that can be used to evaluate climate change impacts on processes that are sensitive to finer-scale climate gradients and the effects of local topography on climate conditions.
The dataset contains monthly projections covering the periods from 1950 through 2005 (Retrospective Run) and from 2006 to 2099 (Prospective Run). It includes downscaled projections from 33 models. Not every scenario contains projections from every model.
NEX-DCP30 was prepared by the Climate Analytics Group and NASA Ames Research Center using the NASA Earth Exchange, and distributed by the NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS).
