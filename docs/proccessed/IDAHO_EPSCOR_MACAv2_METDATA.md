The MACAv2-METDATA dataset is a collection of 20 global climate models covering the conterminous USA. The Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) method is a statistical downscaling method which utilizes a training dataset (i.e. a meteorological observation dataset) to remove historical biases and match spatial patterns in climate model output.
The MACA method was used to downscale the model output from 20 global climate models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) for the historical GCM forcings (1950-2005) and the future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios (2006-2100) from the native resolution of the GCMS to 4km.
