The Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA) is a high resolution, time-stamped Digital Surface Model (DSM) of Antarctica at 2-meter and 8-meter spatial resolutions.
Mosaicked DEM files are compiled from multiple strips that have been co-registered, blended, and feathered to reduce edge-matching artifacts.
