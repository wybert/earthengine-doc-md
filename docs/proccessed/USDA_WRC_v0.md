This dataset depicts components of wildfire risk for all lands in the United States that: 1) are landscape-wide (i.e., measurable at every pixel across the landscape); and 2) represent in situ risk - risk at the location where the adverse effects take place on the landscape.
National wildfire hazard datasets of annual burn probability and fire intensity, generated by the USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Researc Station and Pyrologix LLC, form the foundation of the Wildfire Risk to Communities data. Vegetation and wildland fuels data from LANDFIRE 2020 (version 2.2.0) were used as input to two different but related geospatial fire simulation systems. Annual burn probability was produced with the USFS geospatial fire simulator (FSim) at a relatively coarse cell size of 270 meters (m). The burn probability raster data was upsampled to the native 30 m resolution of the LANDFIRE fuel and vegetation data, to bring the data down to a finer resolution more useful for assessing hazard and risk to communities. In this upsampling process, the provider also spread values of modeled burn probability into developed areas represented in LANDFIRE fuels data as non-burnable.
Burn probability rasters represent landscape conditions as of the end of 2020. Fire intensity characteristics were modeled at 30 m resolution using a process that performs a comprehensive set of FlamMap runs spanning the full range of weather-related characteristics that occur during a fire season and then integrates those runs into a variety of results based on the likelihood of those weather types occurring. Before the fire intensity modeling, the LANDFIRE 2020 data were updated to reflect fuels disturbances occurring in 2021 and 2022. As such, the fire intensity datasets represent landscape conditions as of the end of 2022.
**Pixel Size** 30 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
`BP` |  0  |  0.14  | Annual Burn Probability.  
`CFL` | ft |  0  |  861.7  | Conditional Flame Length; mean flame length for fire burning in direction of maximum spread if a fire were to occur. Avg. measure of wildfire intensity.  
`CRPS` |  0  |  100  | Conditional Risk to Potential Structures; potential consequences of fire to a home at a given location, if a fire occurs there and if a home were located there.  
`Exposure` |  0  |  1  | Measure of how exposed a housing unit would be to wildfire. A value of 1 is "direct" exposure. Values between 0 and 1 represent "indirect" exposure, with higher values representing closer proximity to directly exposed areas  
`FLEP4` |  0  |  1  | Flame Length Exceedance Probability - 4 ft; conditional probability that flame length at a pixel will exceed 4 feet if a fire occurs; indicates the potential for moderate to high wildfire intensity.  
`FLEP8` |  0  |  1  | Farm Length Exceedance Probability - 8 ft; conditional probability that flame length at a pixel will exceed 8 feet if a fire occurs; indicates the potential for high wildfire intensity.  
`RPS` |  0  |  13.2  | Risk to Potential Structures; relative risk to a house if one existed at that location.  
`WHP` |  0  |  99.853  | Wildfire Hazard Potential index.
