[Description](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/TOMS_MERGED#description)[Bands](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/TOMS_MERGED#bands)[Terms of Use](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/TOMS_MERGED#terms-of-use)[Citations](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/TOMS_MERGED#citations) More
The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data represent the primary long-term, continuous record of satellite-based observations available for use in monitoring global and regional trends in total ozone over the past 25 years. The data are produced by the Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Version 8 TOMS data products include level 3 gridded data (1.0 x 1.25 deg). The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), aboard the Aura satellite (July 2004 - current), has a higher resolution (1.0 x 1.0 deg).
These data represent a merged ozone product from TOMS/EarthProbe, TOMS/Nimbus-7, TOMS/Meteor-3, OMI/Aura and USGS-interpolated data for dates with no data.
