The MOD16A2 V105 product provides information about 8-day global terrestrial evapotranspiration at 1km pixel resolution. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere. With long-term ET data, the effects of changes in climate, land use, and ecosystems disturbances can be quantified.
The MOD16A2 product is produced by the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group [NTSG](https://www.ntsg.umt.edu/), University of Montana (UMT) in conjunction with NASA Earth Observing System. For more details about the algorithm used see the [algorithm theoretical basis document](https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1267&context=ntsg_pubs).
  * The period of coverage is 8 days with the exception of the last period at the end of the year which is either 5 or 6 days. ET/PET units are 0.1mm/5-day for December 27-31 of 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 0.1mm/6-day for December 26-31 of 2000, 2004, 2008 (leap years).


** For some pixels in African rainforest, the MODIS albedo data from MCD43B2/MCD43B3 have no cloud-free data throughout an entire year. As a result, pixels for that year in all data bands are masked out.
**Pixel Size** 1000 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Scale | Description  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
`ET` | kg/m^2 |  -5*  |  453*  | 0.1 | Evapotranspiration, aggregated for period of coverage.  
`LE` | J/m^2/day |  -20*  |  1671*  | 10000 | Latent heat flux, averaged daily over the period of coverage.  
`PET` | kg/m^2 |  -8*  |  793*  | 0.1 | Potential evapotranspiration, aggregated for period of coverage.  
`PLE` | J/m^2/day |  -40*  |  3174*  | 10000 | Potential Latent Heat Flux, averaged daily over the period ofcoverage.  
`ET_QC` | ET quality control.  
Bitmask for ET_QC
  * Bit 0: MODLAND_QC bits 
    * 0: Good quality (main algorithm with or without saturation)
    * 1: Other quality (back-up algorithm or fill values)
  * Bit 1: Sensor 
    * 0: Terra
    * 1: Aqua
  * Bit 2: Dead detector 
    * 0: Detectors fine for up to 50% of channels 1, 2
    * 1: Dead detectors caused >50% adjacent detector retrieval
  * Bits 3-4: Cloud state 
    * 0: Significant clouds NOT present (clear)
    * 1: Significant clouds WERE present
    * 2: Mixed cloud present on pixel
    * 3: Cloud state not defined, assumed clear
  * Bits 5-7: SCF_QC (five level confidence score) 
    * 0: Main method used, best result possible (no saturation)
    * 1: Main method used, good and very usable (with saturation)
    * 2: Main method failed due to bad geometry, empirical algorithm used
    * 3: Main method failed due to problems other than geometry, empirical algorithm used
    * 4: Pixel not produced at all, value couldn't be retrieved

  
* estimated min or max value 
**Image Properties**
Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
days_of_coverage | DOUBLE | Number of days covered by each image since the period of coverage for the last asset of the year can be of varying length  
**Terms of Use**
