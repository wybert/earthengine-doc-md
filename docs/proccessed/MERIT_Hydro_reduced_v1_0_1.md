Supplementary visualization layers for [MERIT Hydro](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MERIT_Hydro_v1_0_1)
**Pixel Size** 556.6 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Description  
---|---|---  
`wth` | River channel width at the channel centerlines. River channel width is calculated by the method described in [Yamazaki et al. 2012, WRR], with some improvements/changes on the algorithm. This band was upscaled to 18 arc seconds from the original 3 arc seconds for better visualization at global scale.  
`upa` | km^2 | Upstream drainage area (flow accumulation area). This band was upscaled to 18 arc seconds from the original 3 arc seconds for better visualization at global scale.
