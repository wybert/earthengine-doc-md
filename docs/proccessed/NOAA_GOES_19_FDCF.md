The Fire (HSC) product contains four images: one in the form of a fire mask and the other three with pixel values identifying fire temperature, fire area, and fire radiative power.
The ABI L2+ FHS metadata mask assigns a flag to every earth-navigated pixel that indicates its disposition with respect to the FHS algorithm. Operational users who have the lowest tolerance for false alarms should focus on the "processed" and "saturated" categories (mask codes 10, 11, 30, and 31), but within these categories there can still be false alarms.
Operational data production for GOES-19 began April 7, 2025. Any data prior to this date is provisional.

**Pixel Size** 2000 meters 
**Bands**
Name | Units | Min | Max | Scale | Offset | Description  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
`Area` | m^2 |  0*  |  16723*  | 60.98 | 4000 | Fire area  
`Temp` | K |  0*  |  32642*  | 0.0549367 | 400 | Fire temperature  
`Mask` | Fire mask categories. Pixel values in the fire mask image identify a fire category and diagnostic information associated with algorithm execution. The six fire categories include: Good quality or temporally filtered good quality fire pixel; Saturated fire pixel or temporally filtered saturated fire pixel; Cloud contaminated or temporally filtered cloud contaminated fire pixel; High probability or temporally filtered high probability fire pixel; Medium probability or temporally filtered high probability fire pixel; Low probability or temporally filtered high probability fire. Temporally filtered fire pixels are those resulting from fire pixels that are in close proximity in both space and time.  
`Power` | MW |  0  |  200000  | Fire radiative power  
`DQF` |  0  |  5  | Data quality flags

14 | violet | Medium probability fire  
15 | blue | Low probability fire  
30 | darkred | Processed fire, filtered

33 | darkorange | High probability fire, filtered  
34 | darkviolet | Medium probability fire, filtered  
35 | darkblue | Low probability fire, filtered  
**DQF Class Table**
Value | Color | Description  
---|---|---  
0 | #ffffff | Good quality fire  
1 | #ff00ff | Good quality fire-free land  
2 | #0000ff | Invalid due to opaque cloud  
3 | #00ffff | Invalid due to surface type or sunglint or LZA threshold exceeded or off earth or missing input data  
4 | #ffff00 | Invalid due to bad input data  
5 | #ff0000 | Invalid due to algorithm failure
