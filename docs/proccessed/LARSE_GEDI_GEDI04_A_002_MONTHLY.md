This dataset contains Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) Level 4A (L4A) Version 2 predictions of the aboveground biomass density (AGBD; in Mg/ha) and estimates of the prediction standard error within each sampled geolocated laser footprint. In this version, the granules are in sub-orbits. Height metrics from simulated waveforms associated with field estimates of AGBD from multiple regions and plant functional types (PFTs) were compiled to generate a calibration dataset for models representing the combinations of world regions and PFTs (i.e., deciduous broadleaf trees, evergreen broadleaf trees, evergreen needleleaf trees, deciduous needleleaf trees, and the combination of grasslands, shrubs, and woodlands).The algorithm setting group selection used for GEDI02_A Version 2 has been modified for evergreen broadleaf trees in South America to reduce false positive errors resulting from the selection of waveform modes above ground elevation as the lowest mode. The dataset LARSE/GEDI/GEDI04_A_002_MONTHLY is a raster version of the original GEDI04_A product. The raster images are organized as monthly composites of individual orbits in the corresponding month.

The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation [GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/) mission aims to characterize ecosystem structure and dynamics to enable radically improved quantification and understanding of the Earth's carbon cycle and biodiversity. The GEDI instrument, attached to the International Space Station (ISS), collects data globally between 51.6° N and 51.6° S latitudes at the highest resolution and densest sampling of the 3-dimensional structure of the Earth. The GEDI instrument consists of three lasers producing a total of eight beam ground transects, which instantaneously sample eight ~25 m footprints spaced approximately every 60 m along-track.
