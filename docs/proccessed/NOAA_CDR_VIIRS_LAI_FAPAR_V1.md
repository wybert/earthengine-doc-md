This Climate Data Record (CDR) combines datasets for Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), two biophysical variables that can be used to evaluate vegetation stress, forecast agricultural yields, and other modeling and resource management applications. LAI tracks the one-sided green leaf area per unit of ground surface area, while FAPAR quantifies the solar radiation absorbed by plants within the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectral region. The LAI/FAPAR CDR generates a daily product on a .05° by .05° grid. The data is generated from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors from 2014 onward.
Known issues with this dataset include:
  * TIMEOFDAY variable contains values that are too large by 1 day
  * Latitude values are not correctly associated with the center of the grid cell, error is < 0.002 degrees
  * Longitude values are not correctly associated with the center of the grid cell, error is < 0.02 degrees


See [technical note from the data provider](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/sds/cdr/CDRs/Leaf_Area_Index_and_FAPAR/VIIRS/AlgorithmDescriptionVIIRS_01B-20c.pdf).
Provider's note: the orbital drift of N-19 (the last NOAA satellite carrying the AVHRR sensor) began to severely degrade the retrieved product quality. Therefore, VIIRS is now the primary sensor being used for these products from 2014-present.

**Terms of Use**
The NOAA CDR Program's official distribution point for CDRs is NOAA's National Climatic Data Center which provides sustained, open access and active data management of the CDR packages and related information in keeping with the United States' open data policies and practices as described in the President's Memorandum on "Open Data Policy" and pursuant to the Executive Order of May 9, 2013, "Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information". In line with these policies, the CDR data sets are nonproprietary, publicly available, and no restrictions are placed upon their use. For more information, see the [Fair Use of NOAA's CDR Data Sets, Algorithms and Documentation](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/sds/cdr/CDRs/Aerosol_Optical_Thickness/UseAgreement_01B-04.pdf) pdf.
