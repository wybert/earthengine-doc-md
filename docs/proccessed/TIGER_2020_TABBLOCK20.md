The United States Census Bureau regularly releases a geodatabase named TIGER. This dataset contains the 2020 census blocks, roughly equivalent to a city block. There are just over eight million polygon features covering the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the [Island areas](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/planning-management/release/2020-island-areas-data-products.html).
For full technical details on all TIGER 2020 products, see the [TIGER technical documentation](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/data/tiger/tgrshp2020/TGRSHP2020_TechDoc.pdf).
