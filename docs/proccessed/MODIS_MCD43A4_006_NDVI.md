The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is generated from the Near-IR and Red bands of each scene as (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red), and ranges in value from -1.0 to 1.0. This product is generated from the MODIS/006/MCD43A4 surface reflectance composites.
**Bands**
Name | Min | Max | Pixel Size | Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
`NDVI` |  -1*  |  1*  |  463.313 meters  | Normalized Difference Vegetation Index  
* estimated min or max value
