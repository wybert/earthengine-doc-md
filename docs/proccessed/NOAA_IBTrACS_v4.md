The International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) provides location and intensity for global tropical cyclones. The data span from the 1840s to present, generally providing data at 3-hour intervals. While the best track data is focused on position and intensity (maximum sustained wind speed or minimum central pressure), other parameters are provided by some agencies (e.g., radius of maximum winds, environmental pressure, radius of hurricane force winds, etc.) and are likewise provided in IBTrACS. Files are available subset by Basin or time period, where basins include: East Pacific, North Atlantic, North Indian, South Atlantic, South Indian, South Pacific, and the West Pacific.
**Table Schema**
Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
SID | STRING | Storm Identifier  
SEASON | DOUBLE | Year in which the storm occurred  
NUMBER | DOUBLE | The cardinal number of the system for that season. The count includes all basins, so this will not be continuous for basin files.  
BASIN | STRING | Basins include:
  * NA: North Atlantic
  * EP: Eastern North Pacific
  * WP: Western North Pacific
  * NI: North Indian
  * SI: South Indian
  * SP: Southern Pacific
  * SA: South Atlantic

NATURE | STRING | Combined storm type. This is assigned based on all available storm types. Values:
  * DS: Disturbance
  * TS: Tropical
  * ET: Extratropical
  * SS: Subtropical
  * NR: Not reported
  * MX: Mixture (contradicting nature reports from different agencies)

  
WMO_WIND | DOUBLE | Maximum sustained wind speed from the WMO agency for the current location. NO adjustment is made for differences in wind speed averaging periods. hurdat/atcf = North Atlantic - U.S. Miami (NOAA NHC) - 1-minute winds tokyo = RSMC Tokyo (JMA) - 10-minute newdelhi = RSMC New Delhi (IMD) - 3-minute reunion = RSMC La Reunion (MFLR) - 10 minute bom = Australian TCWCs (TCWC Perth, Darwin, Brisbane) - 10-minute nadi = RSMC Nadi (FMS) - 10 minute wellington = TCWC Wellington (NZMS) - 10-minute  
WMO_PRES | DOUBLE | Minimum central pressure assigned by the responsible WMO agnecy  
WMO_AGENCY | STRING | This is the reporting agency responsible for the basin as currently listed.It should be noted that many of the agencies did not accept official WMO responsibility until relatively recently, e.g., La Reunion in 1993 or IMD in 1990. Therefore the WMO agency is used loosely to describe the currently responsible agency.  
TRACK_TYPE | STRING | Track type Tropical storms can interact. Values:
  * PROVISIONAL: Real time data used to populate the position and other parameters of this system.This is a provisional track that will be replaced when reanalysis of the storm is performed. (Usually within 2 years of the storm's occurence)
  * PROVISIONAL_spur: Real time data (see provisional description above) but due to differences in positions between various inputs, algorithm can not identify accurate position. When counting storms, these should not likely be counted. These should be rare for PROVISIONAL data.
  * MAIN: primary track associated with a storm system. This is a track that has had some reanalysis and is higher quality than provisional data.
  * spur: usually short lived tracks associated with a main track and often represents alternate positions at the beginning of a system. Can also represent actual system interactions (e.g., Fujiwhara interactions).

  
DIST2LAND | DOUBLE | Distance to land from the current position. The land dataset includes all continents and any islands larger than 1400 km^2. The distance is the nearest at the present time in any direction.  
LANDFALL | DOUBLE | Nearest location to land within next 6 hours. This can be thought of a landfall flag: =0 -- Landfall within 6 hours.
> 0 -- No landfall within next 6 hours. Calculations are based on storm center (columns 9,10). Values less than 60 nmile likely are impacted by the system even though the center of the system is not over land. The uses the same land mask as DIST2LAND.

BOM_GUST | DOUBLE | This is the estimated maximum wind gust around the cyclone - that is in the vicinity of the centre based on open terrain estimate  
BOM_GUST_PER | DOUBLE | This is the period of the gust used when measuring max wind gusts. This parameter will only be used when receiving data in WMO format that is not based on 3-sec gusts. All Australian based data should be based on 3-sec gusts.  
REUNION_GUST | DOUBLE | Maximum Wind Gust  
REUNION_GUST_PER | DOUBLE | Gust Period  
USA_SEAHGT | DOUBLE | Wave height for radii defined in SEARAD  
USA_SEARAD_NE | DOUBLE | Radial extent of seas (as defined in SEAHGT) extending from storm center to the Northeast.  
USA_SEARAD_SE | DOUBLE | Radial extent of seas (as defined in SEAHGT) extending from storm center to the Southeast.  
USA_SEARAD_SW | DOUBLE | Radial extent of seas (as defined in SEAHGT) extending from storm center to the Southwest.  
USA_SEARAD_NW | DOUBLE | Radial extent of seas (as defined in SEAHGT) extending from storm center to the Northwest.  
STORM_SPEED | DOUBLE | Translation speed of the system as calculated from the positions in LAT and LON  
STORM_DIR | DOUBLE | Translation direction of the system as calculated from the positions in LAT and LON. Direction is moving toward the vector pointing in degrees east of north [range = 0-360 deg]

The International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) provides location and intensity for global tropical cyclones. The data span from the 1840s to present, generally providing data at 3-hour intervals. While the best track data is focused on position and intensity (maximum sustained wind speed or minimum central pressure), â€¦
