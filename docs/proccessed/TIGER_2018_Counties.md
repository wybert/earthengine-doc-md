The United States Census Bureau TIGER dataset contains the 2018 boundaries for primary legal divisions of US states. In most states, these entities are termed "counties". In Louisiana, these divisions are known as "parishes".
Alaska has governmental entities called "boroughs" which fill a similar governmental role to counties, but in some areas those governmental responsibilities are handled directly by the state and sometimes by a city. For Alaska, county equivalent entities thus include
  1. organized boroughs,
  2. combined city and borough entities (e.g. Juneau),
  3. municipalities, and
  4. census areas.


The census areas are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.
In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as county-equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.
The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions and each area is considered a county-equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: municipios in Puerto Rico, districts and islands in America Samoa, municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
