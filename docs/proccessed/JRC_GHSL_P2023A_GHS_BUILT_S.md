This raster dataset depicts the distribution of built-up surfaces, expressed in square metres per 100 m grid cell. The dataset measures: a) the total built-up surface, and b) the built-up surface allocated to grid cells of predominant non-residential (NRES) use. Data are spatially-temporally interpolated or extrapolated from 1975 to 2030 in 5 year intervals.
The complete information about the GHSL main products can be found in the [GHSL Data Package 2023 report](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/GHSL_Data_Package_2023.pdf?t=1683540422)
The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project is supported by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre, and Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy.
