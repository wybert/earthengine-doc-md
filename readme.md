## What's this for?

This is markdown versions of the [Google Earth Engine documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) without the Dataset Catalog. It aims to provide an automated way to generate updated markdown files from the original documentation. It could serve as a knowledge base for LLMs and other AI models. It could be integrated with Context7.

You can find the similar project for Earth Engine Dataset Catalog at [earthengine-dataset-catalog-md](https://github.com/wybert/earthengine-dataset-catalog-md).
